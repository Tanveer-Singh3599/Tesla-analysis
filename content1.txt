Avoid Tesla Energy — Extremely Unprofessional and Disrespectful ExperienceThis has been one of the most frustrating and disappointing customer service experiences I’ve ever had. I’m a disabled U.S. Army veteran, and I had a Tesla Powerwall system installed at my home. From the very beginning, the installation resulted in serious electrical issues, including a non-functional breaker and no power in one of my backyard outlets — a clear safety hazard.I contacted Tesla immediately and have sent over 30 emails over the course of six months trying to get this resolved. Despite multiple technician visits, nothing was fixed. When a technician finally did come out, he chose to install a damaged, unreliable outlet, even though I offered him a new outlet from my closet. He refused to use it. Later, it turned out that the outlet he installed wasn’t even working.After months of back-and-forth, someone from Tesla’s Energy Resolutions Department reached out to try to fix the issue. However, by then I had already paid for the repair myself — in cash, because I couldn’t wait any longer with a hazard on my property. Because I didn’t have a formal receipt, Tesla refused to compensate me, even though their own technician had confirmed the issue was due to their original poor installation.I also made Tesla aware, in writing, that I live with a service-connected disability that affects memory (protected under the ADA), and I specifically requested reasonable accommodations. Tesla ignored this, continued to pursue an unjustified $300 charge, and showed zero regard for my situation or my rights.This company has shown a total lack of professionalism, respect, and basic human decency throughout this entire process. No accountability. No empathy. No solutions. Just delays, dismissiveness, and blame-shifting.I strongly urge others to stay far away from Tesla Energy. If this is how they treat veterans and people with disabilities, it says a lot about their corporate values. This experience was not only disappointing — it was shameful.

Absolutely unacceptable customer service from Tesla Insurance. This is the third time I’ve had to deal with ridiculous hold times. Today I was on hold for over an hour (1 hour and 8 minutes, to be exact — I have the screenshot to prove it) while calling 1 (844) 348-3752, and no one ever answered.This is not how an insurance company should treat its customers. I’m canceling my policy because I’ve lost all trust in Tesla Insurance’s ability to provide even basic support. If this is how they handle phone calls, I don’t want to find out how they handle actual claims.

I have 2 Powerwalls series 2. they worked well for 10 months. then 1 started tripping off when it was charging. Instead of fixing the issue they have changed the settings so it won't charge as fast now I can't charge them overnight with my car as the Gateway only lets 8 or 9 kw through at a time. My biggest grip is that they are completely unresponsive I reported the problem 6 weeks ago and nothing apart from a refrence number. nearlly £27,000 for the system and they don't even care. This issue is costing me money and they couldn't care less.

Well.  I have had my Tesla model 3 under 2 years.  Started to have charging issues.  Car wouldn't accept charge but in fact mileage was going down overnight.  In the end car had to be recovered to closest Tesla garage leaving me without transport.  My first text saidy battery was good for age and mileage of the car.  Great.But then it said my car required a part, at no cost.  FineBut it's taken 6 weeks for part to get to garage. Astronauts have been rescued by Mr Musk  quicker!  Now, it will take 6 days to put in the part, whatever it is, test and charge the car.  Making 8 weeks without transport.And I bought a Tesla why ?

Once I was the biggest Tesla fan. I even preordered a model 3  before it first came out. Two year into a Model Y (LR) ownership the issues started. We were on a trip to the beach last weekend and the car died on a parking lot. They towed it and we had to Uber everywhere during our stay and ask some random people to take us back home to DC. Uber to work all week because they were unable to provide a loaner. After a week I had to drive down to Norfolk (4hrs) to pick it up. They replaced some front control module but after I picked it up I went to a supercharger and it wasn’t charging. We had to wait another night for a slow charger to fully charge so we can make it back home. Barely made it to the local dealer in Tysons (at 8%) and they said we can’t take you today because the vehicle is still charging. How ridiculous! Just a few months ago the driver window shattered on closing due to some faulty mechanism. Done being a 60K Tesla experiment. Going with a true, reliable car brand!

Dear Tesla Global Support,I placed an order for a Wall Connector on July 17th, 2025 (Order No: MYVXENXYF4) via Tesla Turkey’s official store. However, the item is still stuck in Turkish customs and has never been delivered to me. UPS tracking number: 1ZFA70730413508994I tried to cancel the order shortly after purchasing, once I saw hundreds of complaints online about delivery issues. However, there was no cancel button, no customer support, and no one to talk to.Now the package is stuck at customs, and Tesla Turkey refuses to process a refund until I physically receive the item — which is impossible due to the customs delay.This means I am being financially penalized for something out of my control.I request an immediate cancellation and full refund (₺29,670) for a product I have not received and cannot receive. Tesla’s lack of proper communication and support in Turkey is damaging the company’s global reputation.Please take this seriously and escalate this matter to someone with authority.Sincerely,İbrahim Ceylan

I love my cyber truck.I wasn’t sure what to expect when I picked up the Cybertruck.  I've now had it for over a year.  It's the best vehicle I've ever owned.  People get too caught up in politics, EV polarization, or simply the fact that its different than what they're used to.The Cybertruck delivers on the hype. It’s absurdly powerful, eerily quiet, and built like a better tank. The steel exterior turns heads everywhere—and despite the rugged look, it rides incredibly smooth.The interior is deceptively spacious and thoughtfully designed. The tech is intuitive (as you’d expect from Tesla), and the turning radius is surprisingly tight for a truck this size. Off-road performance? Absolutely bonkers. I’ve already taken it across terrain I wouldn’t have dared with other 4x4s.What really sets it apart is how fun it is to drive. It feels like a tank and a spaceship had a baby—and it hauls like one too.Yes, it’s unconventional. No, it’s not for everyone, but it should be. For me? Its hands down the most exciting, capable, and futuristic vehicle I’ve ever owned.

Tesla has the worst customer service on earth . Their service department in Birmingham Alabama is the worst . Very low quality service and unresponsive and unreliable Also the Tesla dealership in Chattanooga Tennessee have the worst customer service and the worst Tesla advisors . Unhelpful, unprofessional, unresponsive and their cars have too many issues . They will NOT honor their warranty I regret buying a Tesla

Over all happy with the car. the ghost braking is a nightmare sometimes, and when driving small roades, in witch we have a lot of, the stay in your lain warning system just goes bananas, and actually makes it more dangerous, as it sometimes try to correct you, but you have oncoming traffic :-( car is from 2024, and have only one case with service, and that played out smooth... And then there is Elon Musk!!!!!! he needs to go on hes medicines again. that is no okay behavior....

I scheduled a 48-hour test drive with Tesla over a month ago, and received multiple confirmations by text. I planned my schedule around it, only to show up at the dealership and be told “we don’t do 48-hour test drives anymore, it’s 30 minutes only.”No one informed me of this change ahead of time. When I showed them the confirmation text, the employee shrugged and said she didn’t know who sent it, as if I fabricated it.This was a complete waste of time and showed zero accountability on Tesla’s part. If this is how Tesla treats potential customers, it makes me question the experience of ownership even more.Extremely disappointed.

Much the same as others are saying, Love the car but Tesla customer service is so bad, If you have a problem your on your own they literally don’t care or they have a policy to not fake care of there customers, I just pray i don’t have a problem with the car for the next 3 years, so far I'm happy with the car but if i could rewind id not have given tesla my business as they truly don’t deserve it. Worst customer service !

I chose Tesla after a random test drive and I was blown away by it so I bought the new model 3 Highland long range and it's been a truly awesome car. It seems well put together, it's quiet, comfortable and reliable and gets 5 miles/kw on a trip. Long drives are a real pleasure. After a year of ownership I am still very happy with it.

The customer service is appalling, at least at Milton Keynes Service Centre. They expect people to leave their cars by 9.30 am and yet say they won't start working on it and that it may not be available until 5pm. No consideration of lunch time drops off, no thought for customer's working commitments and no flexibility whatsoever. The message is fit around us or get lost'. I do think Tesla will need to up its game if it expects to keep customers--service is key when deciding either to purchase another car of the same make. As it is it is already very inconvenient as there are so few garages around. I not that sales are falling  in the UK. I predict they will continue to do so if customer service doesn't improve. There are lot of alternatives electric car models available that can be serviced by local garages.

Had my Powerwall 3 for a few months now and it works brilliantly. I did have one issue but this was resolved quickly and efficiently. I wish the energy companies were as competent.

Purchased a Tesla in late 2024 after a great FSD (Full Self-Driving) test drive where the car performed wonderfully. But once I received my own vehicle, I experienced multiple issues within weeks. On my third FSD use, the car failed to properly enter a left-turn lane and collided with another vehicle’s bumper. Multiple other attempts to use FSD left us disillusioned — the car makes poor driving decisions, and you need the reaction speed of Superman to stop it before something goes wrong.The windshield wipers didn’t function reliably until after a service appointment — despite the technician stating no repairs were made. Backup alerts are inconsistent, often missing both visual and audible warnings. In one case, I nearly backed into a moving car with no warning at all.I brought the car in for service and spent hours with the team, only to be told nothing was wrong. Ultimately, the service team said there was “nothing more they could do” and suggested submitting a buyback request — which I did. After more than 30 days and multiple follow-ups, I’ve received no response.We’ve stopped using FSD and installed a third-party screen to access continuous blind spot alerts, since Tesla’s native interface does not display them. Ultimately, I regret this purchase and do not feel Tesla took responsibility for the issues. I've given two stars to acknowledge that it is an electric car and has reduced our fuel expense — but it has increased our safety risks compared to the older vehicle it replaced.

Sold my Model 3 back to Tesla in the UK and still waiting for my finance to be cleared by Tesla. I've now been waiting for 7 weeks and about to enter Week 8. Continue to chase but not getting any commitment - only to be told that they are dealing with a backlog. People must be dumping these vehicles rapidly and with this level of customer service it's clear to see why. Complaint sent to financial ombudsman. Shocking service and case still ongoing.

I’m posting this to warn other Tesla Model 3 owners about a deeply frustrating and expensive experience with my 2019 Model 3.Just 8 months out of warranty, my car completely shut down while driving — no warning, no accident, just a full power failure mid-ride. I had it towed to Tesla Service and was told the rear drive unit needed to be replaced, along with the pyrotechnic battery disconnect system. Total repair estimate? $4,832.13.What’s shocking is:	•	This car has been well-maintained and has never been in a collision.	•	The drive unit failure is a major issue in an EV — and feels like something Tesla should stand behind longer than the 4-year/50k mile warranty.	•	Despite the seriousness of the failure, Tesla provided no warranty support or goodwill discount, aside from topping off windshield fluid and doing a tire pressure check for free.	•	Labor was billed at $260/hour — higher than many luxury dealerships.	•	No recall, no service bulletin, no offer of assistance. Just a huge bill.I get that cars cost money, and EVs have complex components. But a $2,500+ drivetrain failure this soon after warranty expiry? That’s unacceptable. Tesla should at minimum have offered partial coverage for something so critical — especially when it involves safety systems like the pyrotechnic disconnect.If you own or are considering a Tesla out of warranty, be prepared: you’re one breakdown away from a massive repair bill, and there’s no safety net once you cross that warranty line.Ask about extended warranty plans, and be cautious of the “low maintenance” pitch. My experience proves that when something breaks, it breaks big — and Tesla leaves you on the hook.

I take no pleasure in writing this negative review, but I feel compelled to share my experience in the hope that it will inform and caution other Tesla customers about what they might encounter at the Tesla Mt Gravatt service center.I own a 2023 Tesla Model 3 RWD with 109,000 km on the odometer. One day, the boot began malfunctioning—it attempted to open but then immediately locked itself. I was still able to open and close it manually, so I continued using it that way. After contacting Tesla, they promptly diagnosed the issue and confirmed that the left-hand side power strut in the trunk needed replacement. Communication was conducted via the app and over the phone.At no point was I advised to stop using the boot manually—despite Tesla being fully aware of the mechanical issue. I continued to use it cautiously until one day, the power strut bent and shattered my rear glass. When I returned to the service center, the first thing a staff member asked was whether anyone had told me not to use the boot. Clearly, they knew such use could cause further damage—but no such warning was ever given.Following this, Tesla Mt Gravatt refused to accept any responsibility for failing to warn me of the potential consequences. They acknowledged the defect but took no accountability for the resulting damage.If you're a Tesla owner or considering becoming one, be warned: Tesla's service model can leave you stranded—even when they’re fully aware of risks that could lead to serious damage. Whether this is due to negligence or a deliberate strategy to generate more revenue is for you to decide—but in either case, the customer pays the price.

I recently had an extremely disappointing experience at the Brent Cross delivery centre during the scheduled handover of my Tesla Model Y.Despite the Tesla app indicating that everything was complete and ready for delivery, we were unexpectedly told upon arrival that the finance agreement hadn’t been signed. There had been no prior communication—no notification on the app, no email, no phone call—nothing to indicate that any action was still required.Rather than helping to resolve the issue, the staff left us waiting for over 90 minutes with no guidance or real assistance. Their attitude felt dismissive and unprofessional, showing little interest in helping or even communicating with us. It seemed like their priority was getting through the day, not supporting a customer at a key milestone.Eventually, I had to contact the finance provider myself and resolve the issue—something Tesla staff should have assisted with but didn’t. Even after the issue was resolved, we were left waiting without any explanation or urgency.For such a major purchase, this kind of customer service is simply unacceptable. Delivery day should be exciting and seamless—not frustrating and poorly handled.Tesla needs to seriously address the service standards at this location. This was a letdown, and not at all in line with what one expects from a premium brand.

Absolutely negative attitude towards this company and its attitude towards customers who bring them money. I ordered a Tesla Model 3, paid the money and waited. The deadlines were postponed several times and they just presented me with a fait accompli. Then Tesla informed me that my car had arrived and booked a pickup date in two days and 3 minutes before the appointment they called me and said that the car was damaged, but if I wanted I could pick it up. They did not offer me other options or a discount. I asked when the next delivery would be and they said they did not know, maybe two weeks or more. They offered to return the money minus $ 250. This is absolute disrespect for the client. Also, do not even think about contacting Tesla insurance. Everything is very slow, you can be on hold on the phone for 3 hours or more.

I bought a Tesla Model 3 and ordered the Gen 3 Mobile Connector to charge it at home. Turns out it's not compatible with Tesla's own NEMA 14-30 adapter from the previous generation – which I already had installed in my garage.That’s frustrating enough, but when I returned the charger (literally untouched, just opened the box), Tesla refused to accept the return because the box was opened.Seriously? I just bought your car, your charger isn’t compatible with your own adapter, and now you’re telling me I can’t return it?Come on @Tesla — this isn’t how you treat your customers. I'm honestly really disappointed.

Tesla Insurance is an absolute nightmare. I filed a claim and heard nothing back for over a month. No adjuster, no updates, no communication whatsoever. Trying to get someone on the phone is nearly impossible, and when you do, they’re unhelpful and clearly out of their depth.It feels like they’ve set up an insurance company with no intention of actually handling claims. Total lack of professionalism and accountability. Save yourself the stress — go with a real insurance provider.

Their CEO Had Bought Out Project Veritas & As The OBO Founder, Top DOGE Member, Global Mint's Not Only Him, Trump Junior Had Tap-In CEO, "Murdered American Small Business", What A Criminal, Independence, (Not A Dictatorship Again) Red Independence Dude.

Id give Tesla 0 stars. The worst company I have ever dealt with by a mile. Estimated delivery on a car was September 2024 , they kept pushing out the delivery ....cancelled in April. I had to sell the charger I bought with the car on a separate site (adverts.ie) for half the price originally bought it for as I couldn't get a refund. Stay well clear from these and explore other EVs. My incident happened in Dublin, Ireland

Financed a pre-owned Tesla purchase for my son from Tesla Bristol. They require the purchaser to pay upfront for the car before viewing it with the option of rejection if it doesn't come up to standard. When we saw the car the presentation was awful. It had several chips down to the metal and scrapes along the bottom of the car where it had probably impacted a speed bump or such. Furthermore, it hadn't even been cleaned properly. The people at handover said they viewed it as acceptable, but we decided to reject it. We were told a refund would take up to 14 days, which we thought was unreasonable. However, after 2 weeks the £200 deposit has been refunded but the balance of almost £22,000 it's still outstanding. Tesla say that it has been processed but the bank have no record and have asked for payment confirmation from Tesla. They seem to think that because the initial £200 deposit has been refunded the process is complete.The upshot of all this is that my son has no car and I'm down £22,000. It's no wonder Elon Musk is a billionaire.

I have been a loyal Tesla owner and fan of the brand — but my experience with Tesla Insurance has been deeply disappointing.On April 3, 2025, my Tesla Model Y was involved in a collision. I immediately filed a claim (CL-37-92LVEY-1), submitted all necessary documents by April 4, and provided a supplemental estimate on May 15. As of May 27 — 53 days later — I have received no decision, no approval, and no formal communication.This delay has caused:	•	A significant loss of income, as I use this vehicle for Uber.	•	Emotional stress due to lack of updates or resolution.	•	Inability to replace my car or buy a new Tesla, as the damaged vehicle is unsafe to drive and the claim is still pending.I’ve filed a formal complaint with the California Department of Insurance and escalated to Tesla’s executive team. I sincerely hope this review encourages Tesla Insurance to act responsibly and communicate transparently with customers — especially those who rely on their vehicles for work and safety.

I had an unforgettable experience at the Tesla Sheffield store, where the team, led by the phenomenal Paige and her colleagues, went above and beyond by offering me an overnight test drive of the Tesla Model Y Launch Edition. Their professionalism and enthusiasm made the entire process seamless, showcasing the car’s brilliance in a way that left me truly impressed.Having tested other electric vehicles like the Volkswagen ID.4 and BMW iX, I can confidently say the Tesla Model Y is light-years ahead. Those competitors’ reliance on Apple CarPlay was a nightmare—laggy, unintuitive, and frustratingly unresponsive, with small screens that made app control a chore. Charging them was equally cumbersome, requiring multiple apps and lacking clear navigation for charging stops. In stark contrast, the Model Y’s massive, crystal-clear, lag-free touchscreen is a game-changer, offering seamless phone integration and an intuitive interface that’s a joy to use. Planning trips is effortless, with the navigation system clearly mapping out Supercharger stops, making charging fast and stress-free. After this drive, it’s clear that internal combustion engines are relics of the past—Tesla has redefined what driving can be.Compared to earlier Model Y versions, the Launch Edition’s suspension is a revelation, difference like night and day, while road noise is virtually eliminated, creating a serene cabin. The upgraded seats are exceptionally comfortable, and the ventilated front seats were a lifesaver on a sweltering 28-29°C day, keeping me cool and sweat-free. The reclining rear seats, paired with a dedicated touchscreen for passengers to control music, videos, and climate, add a luxurious touch that my family loved. With generous legroom for tall passengers and easy installation of a baby seat, the Model Y is a dream for families. The panoramic glass roof, infused with silver inserts to block UV rays and heat, kept the cabin comfortable and stunningly bright, even in blazing sun.The Model Y’s luggage compartment is a standout, far surpassing competitors like the Volkswagen ID. While the ID forced me to puzzle bags and adjust seats to fit them, the Model Y’s spacious trunk effortlessly swallowed four massive suitcases with zero hassle—packing was completely stress-free. The single stalk for turn signals is a thoughtful feature, especially for those not used to the button-based system I tried (and loved) in the new Model 3—though I opted for the Model Y’s family-friendly space. The ambient lighting, with infinite color options, creates a stylish, personalized vibe, and the audio system is phenomenal—crisp, immersive, and far superior to my old BMW 6 Series’ Harman Kardon setup.This test drive was nothing short of transformative. The Model Y’s blend of cutting-edge technology, unmatched comfort, and family-oriented practicality, combined with the UK’s unmissable 0% APR offer, sealed the deal for me to place an order. A heartfelt thank you to Paige and the Tesla Sheffield team for an exceptional experience—I’m beyond thrilled to join the Tesla family and can’t wait to hit the road in my Model Y!

BOUGHT 2 CARS IN 13 DAYS Certified, both damaged! The car I bought had clear signs of previous accident damage and poor repair work. The boot lid was badly misaligned with the rear lights, with uneven and inconsistent panel gaps on both sides. The tail lights didn’t line up correctly, and the rear panel edges were visibly stepped and uneven.Inside the boot, the bolts had tool marks showing they had been removed or adjusted, and the seam sealer and paint looked sloppy and rushed – definitely not factory work. There were obvious signs of overspray, rough paint texture, and dust trapped in the clear coat. One area even showed orange peel and bubbling.This car had clearly been involved in a rear-end collision and resprayed – none of which was disclosed. If I hadn’t checked panel lines, hinges, and paint properly, I would’ve been misled by the clean exterior. Buyers beware.Then got told I could return it and buy a different one, The sales advisor G told me there would be no mileage charge and I purchased a tesla £2000 more expensive. I was told that the area manager would call be and I have text also stating this! again no call, then G to email me charging me £600 for mileage. So it was just a lie clearly, I have the email!I also travelled from Glasgow to London to pick the car up costing £300, as soon as I was 30 miles away the cars warning lights where flashing and the suspention felt wrong!It was like being in the wild west, G told me that he wants the customers to have a great experience, well well if you are into experiences being Traumatizing this is the place to be!!!Take your money and tell you what you want to hear just to get anything sold!There is so much more I could write here but I am still wanting on my call back from the supervisor, that will never come.RN12**24*78 was the first number order!RN12***5860 is the new order number!Also put in a complaint, no complaint reference number, asked for the complaints procedure, nothing supplied, asked how to complain to the ombudsman and yet again nothing.YEEEHAAA !!!!!Don’t worry, I ordered a new one and picked it up 13 days later, aww hold on that was a shambles too. So after the first problems, George told me dartford is not like reading, reading is the first car above! The new car from dartford that I had ordered was well …….. going to get double checked and make sure there is no issue! Well after a flight and 2 trains and the double checks, they showed me the car in the dark! But when we took it outside the building! There it was, a smash on the side door on the side panel. This does not need to be disclosed apparently or spoke about because it does not affect the driving/handling of the car, it’s just the look of it! Just anyone looking at it from the passenger side. The glass, had a chip out the windscreen, scratches over the back two windows, scratches all over each door panel. It was dirty inside everywhere, stains on the chairs, not hoovered, dirt all along the panels inside and outside panels. But because it has a heated steering wheel that’s more important than the smash in the side or the cleaning. 2 cars 13 days apart, 3 years old 30,000 miles each car, BOTH WITH UNDISCLOSED DAMAGE but because this does not affect the drive then the damage on the car! Who give a toss about this. The damage is factored into the price apparently!Certified used crash cars! Perfect! Considering I was on the phone all week with them about the last car! They don’t check anything or they do and have no standards! Let’s be honest here they just want to sell the car to anyone and hope they don’t notice the damage! I have now spent £300/£400 on travel from Scotland to London twice and they are selling cars that have previous undisclosed damage! I have photos of everything I wish I could upload them. They are not refunding all my expenses, they are how ever giving me £100 back. Do not buy a used car from here, if you do, only do so if you want a certified previous crash test dummy! The body in both cars where all scratches! I understand now why people go to BMW, it’s about standards! Here there is just clearly none! None in reading and none in dartford. I offered to take the car if they took money off the car for me to get the damage fixed or for them to fix the damage, they said no! So they are going to sell it to someone else. Standards! They kept saying to me, everyone. We want you to have a good experience! It’s like their slogan! If you enjoy high blood pressure, traveling to pick up crash test dummy cars and being out of pocket! This is the experience for you! Make sure you get the cleaners from reading or dartford on your cars! Don’t forget the double and triple checks they do wink wink, I was wondering why they said they would send me photos of the car all week and never done it. Get your self down to Teslas Del Boys! Top notch cars wink wink!!

Service and mechanical quality sucksImpossible to get to talk to a technical person and car could be out for months if something needed from Tesla.

I own two Teslas. Overall, the car is well engineered and handles very well. The issue is dealing with the millennials who work at Tesla. Most of them don't know squat about the cars. Getting where the car serviced is an ordeal, particularly with all the rules and regulations that are ridiculous. Too bad there are not privately owned shops that I can take the car to be serviced.

Disgraceful Company avoid at all costs!I am at the end of my tether with this company they are ignorant and do not conduct business professionally. I have been overcharged and cannot get my money back as they do not respond to emails. I have lodged numerous complaints no response My health is suffering as a consequence to this appalling treatment, I had to go to hospital due to the stress and anxiety I am suffering. I have had 2 strokes and recently had major surgery to remove a tumour of which they have been informed and they still can’t respond. Sunny in the Financial Financial Services is a culprit I have written multiple emails and he does not respond. Look forward to your Karma Avoid like the plague!!! You will regret dealing with them

It’s worst car that you can pay for, they said it’s gonna drive 500 km but, never could drive more then 200km even if the car was empty with just a driver in normal street

Horrible service! Bought a brand new car.. Had no idea how to use everything.. Barely gave me an explanation how to drive or adjust settings. Now I am being charge for self driveless subscription.. Had no idea, never used and will not refund me... Horrible customer service.. Wish I saw these reviews before buying my car..

I used to be a Tesla fan boy (aka idiot/loser) but frankly they're useless. I used to overlooked being on a motorway at 70 mph... then heavy rain and window wipers that didn't work. Dangerous and in reality  potentially deadly for you and your family.Then if you have issues, you'll realise why Elon is busy trying to build robots. They'd do a better service... even if they weren't powered on.If you get an electric make sure its not a Tesla. BYD and many other brands out there.I actually went back to a non-electric and I love not wasting my life at Tesla charging stations.You quickly get bored of the silly features the car has. Especially when your window wipers don't function.

I’ve had multiple issues with my 2024 model3.  The biggest was when the battery died after a year of ownership.  They did replace with a refurbished, not new battery, but the customer service is the pits! Now I have an issue with something I ordered in the app which they conveniently charged me 250 over what it said I owed and they won’t take care of it.  So basically nice car to drive, but the absolute worst customer service.  They don’t give a hoot after you’ve bought the car.  I’ll never buy another !

No phone number to speak to anyone so 100% reliance on app. Many service messages go unanswered or take days to get a reply, making it very difficult to organise a service. Eventually having managed to book my car in for a service, Tesla tell me they need the loan car back half way through the service, possibly leaving me with no transport for the bank holiday. Won't now reply to messages to sort this out. Phoned Tesla customer helpline who also could not get through to the Bicester garage and no contact with them so far. A complete disgrace.Car might be OK, but if the servicing and customer support is so awful, it makes it unusable. Never again.

Charged 'Idle Fees' when I over-ran my charger due to disabled 87 year mother on a blue badge. Politely asked for a waiver (twice) - just got ignored. Nobody else was even on the rank that day. What an inhumane, ruthless and thoroughly unpleasant organisation.

Very poor customer service and failure to resolve issues. Would not recommend them to anyone. I have been trying to resolve payment issue for 3 weeks no one waht to know or try to resolve.

After purchasing a Cybertruck in 2024, now in 2025, seven months later, I’ve faced relentless issues. Tesla staff switched the VIN number over 15 times. I spoke with corporate, who claimed to have resolved this ongoing issue with the Cybertruck Foundation series. Corporate approved exceptions and had a truck shipped from Florida to Texas. However, a day before we were set to pick up the truck, we were told there was an issue with the original truck, and the VIN was switched again. After daily updates on the truck’s status the final week, financing was approved, insurance was uploaded, and the car contract was signed—everything was set, and I owned the car.Then, the corporate representative who sorted everything out left the company. A man named Alex from corporate called, claiming I couldn’t pick up my car. He knew this was a gift for my daughter and that we’d endured six months of issues, yet he made every excuse to prevent me from picking up the truck shipped to Texas for our contract. He falsely claimed the financing wasn’t approved when it was and said he couldn’t lease a 2024 model, despite corporate approval. After his gaslighting lies failed and he couldn’t explain why he was blocking us from picking up the truck, it became clear Tesla was sabotaging their own sale. Keep in mind, they held thousands of dollars of our money.This process was emotionally taxing. For seven months, we were repeatedly told, “Hurry, you’re getting a car,” only for it to fall through. The trade-in process was a mess, with the team continuously sabotaging the sale through their app. These people do not know how to sell cars, respect customers, or manage a business—this is why they’re losing millions. I hope no one is ever treated this way, especially as this was a gift for my daughter.We ended up purchasing two new cars the same day from another dealership with excellent service. I still haven’t received my Tesla refund. The Tesla experience—complete with recorded calls and screenshots of app communication—was a traumatic buying ordeal no one should endure. I wrote this review to warn others against wasting time with Tesla.I love my new BMW i7 M with self-parking, advanced driving features, and more electric options than Tesla. BMW South Austin provided the best service! Tesla also played games with free charging, car wraps, and trade-in values, which varied by thousands depending on the associate, further complicating financing. They were dishonest throughout.I would never recommend Tesla to anyone. Car sales should be taken seriously. I reached out to corporate again, but the representative only talked about their personal family issues instead of ensuring the customer received the car as agreed upon. This was insane, pathetic, and intentional.

The company is awesome because they fullfil there promise

The Tesla I bought last year has had problems with the suspension constantly and the brakes keep.engsging spontaneously when I am driving. Basically the vehicle is rubbish, I am trying to sell it but no one wants to buy it! I have wasted and lost alot of money on this vehicle - it's been a nightmare !

Tesla supercharger is Scam , showed it will charge but nothing happened and they charged £20 for idle

By wilfully alienating his customer base Musk has caused irreversible harm to Tesla. His degraded brand is now very uncool and deeply undesirable.Tesla’s expensive and ageing models have now been rapidly overtaken by cheaper, more efficient and more desirable EV’s which aren’t contaminated by association with Musk.

After four years car was returned at the end of lease in February. From the day of return all communications from the company ceased.The car was unregistered from me and Tesla removed it from my account. This effectively cut me off from any further support contacts.An invoice was issued for wear and tear, only viewable in the Tesla app. Which I could not do due to the car being removed. I also could not pay the invoice as this was done....via the app. Eventually managed to speak to a person who emailed me the invoice and breakdown. They are attempting to charge for car mats which were not provided with the vehicle. I responded disputing the charge and have not received a response.Six weeks on and emailing twice a week to Tesla Finance for assistance in efforts to clear this situation up have yielded no results.This has been an absolute disgraceful failure of customer service and I implore people to either buy out their car and sell privately or just not take one in the first place. Once they know you don't want another Tesla they don't want to know you.

Worst car company in the world.  Tesla has stolen $500 from me.

Unfortunately, I had to file a complaint about my Model 3 because the wood trim had come loose. The panel was replaced by the mobile service. Unfortunately, I didn't notice until a few days later that the mechanic had damaged a door panel during the replacement. Tesla now claims I contacted them too late and that their mechanic didn't damage the car. It would have happened to me. However, you can't reach this area during normal use, and it's clear that this damage is from removing the panel. It's a shame; I wasn't expecting that. Absolutely, take pictures before taking your vehicle to Tesla.

My car’s been in the shop more than it's been on the road. Totally overpriced, terrible customer service, and I regret buying it. Never again.

If you are considering buying a Tesla, you should know that your money will be used to support extremist right wing causes.  Their model lineup is aging, they've only released one new car in the last 5 years, the Cybertruck, which is a lemon.  Many other automakers make better electric vehicles today.

My entire family loves Tesla; we own all the S3XY models, including the Cybertruck. The key is managing expectations; I don’t expect a Tesla to match the quality of my Rolls-Royce, but as a daily driver, it’s exceptional and easily the most fun car I own. Now, if Elon would just deliver the Roadster, I’d be completely satisfied.

not good cars. dont buy it

My model 3 was okay at the start however the battery life did not last as expected. The garage staff are excellent however I've had recurring steering problems and the thing seems to veer to the right inexplicably hence my review. I'm going to sell and purchase a Polestar after all this, and the tanking reputation of the company is the last straw.

Broken down, UK10.30 amTesla called, impossible to get any answer fast. On the side of the road, car stuck, Tesla called me from 12.35 am Denmark saying they are waiting for Tesla Manchester to authorise some one to come out. Dreadful service. 12.45 Tesla called to say bring the car to our Service station, if you cannot drive it contact your Insurance company.Next Car will be a BMW

I strongly advise against buying anything from Tesla. Not even a small item. My experience with their customer service has been, and still is, terrible.I ordered a product from their e-shop, specifically from the lifestyle section, on February 6, 2025. The next day, I requested to cancel the order by email and phone, but Tesla ignored my request and shipped it anyway a week later. As instructed by their support team, I refused the package, and it was successfully returned to Tesla’s warehouse on February 21, 2025.Despite my follow-ups and sending proof that the package was returned, I heard nothing from Tesla for two weeks. They claimed my refund was processed on March 7, 2025, but I still haven’t received my money. Now they’ve stopped responding entirely, and I’m left without a solution.It should not take nearly two months to process a simple refund. Their poor communication and lack of care have been extremely frustrating.I had been considering purchasing a Tesla Model Y, but this experience has completely changed my mind. If they can’t handle a basic refund, I can’t imagine trusting them with something as big as a car purchase.I strongly do not recommend buying from Tesla.

Worst customer service I've experienced, even in comparison to internet providers. After paying the reservation fee for a Tesla vehicle, I was basically ghosted for 10 days. No phone number to talk to anyone. The app offers a chat feature, but the only response you get is "someone will be contacting you shortly". My representative is always extremely busy and can never look into the matter. Just a very disappointing experience. Now I'm waiting for a refund of the reservation fee, and it seems like my headaches have just begun. Pray for me.

I recently had the misfortune of owning a Tesla, and I must say it's been a disappointing experience. The car's reliability issues have left me stranded on multiple occasions, and the customer service has been unresponsive and unhelpful.The Model Y I purchased seemed like a great idea at first, but the quality control has been subpar. The car's autonomous driving features have been glitchy, and the charging system has been finicky. Not to mention the software updates that have caused more problems than they've solved.I'm not alone in my frustrations, as it seems like multiple Tesla owners are experiencing similar issues. The company's stock price may be taking a hit, but for me, it's the quality of the product that's the real concern.

I have been driving Tesla cars for about 10 years, starting with a Model S 85D, Model X P100D, Model Y. Over time servicing experience has got worse, repairs have got more expensive, charging experience has got worse, build quality has never improved. To insult i paid for FSD and never received it!!!Never again, my current Tesla lease ends soon and i will never be coming back to this brand, ever. Stay away, there are plenty of better brands available now.

Worst support I've ever experienced. A car that is dependent on your application and you cannot log in. Just send all your personal information and then there will be silence. No answer to the challenge. Thank you Tesla. Now I know it was my last buy.

Tesla is the worst company ever. They rob you by subscribing to their services and then they have a policy for no refunds in any case, even if it’s the first day of subscription and the customer has not used the service even once. They have an average car with a below average drive experience. Coupled with horrible customer service policies, it’s a nightmare to own a Tesla. Stay away from them, there are much better options in the market in this price range.

I had a model Y. But since that ketamine addicted Boss seems to become completely out of his mind i sold it for almost a scrap price. Also there was no moment of driverfun without errors or other defects. I guess Tesla can cancel it's production in Europe. Nobody with any common sense wants to support that 2 mental patiënts.

Tesla change upper or lower control arm on my Tesla model 3. They are little bit expensive or too expensive but they do the job properly. Still happy with their service

When I bought my Model S, I did not expect to be a captive client financing Elon Musk’s extremist political agenda. I cannot wait to get rid of this car that now stands as a banner for climate change denial.

Worst customer service experience. I ordered a 7 seater model Y car December 2024, told to expect delivery early 2025. Just to get a voice message to say my order has been cancelled by Ricky - Tesla Maidenhead, England.That’s a new low from Tesla, reflects such poor customer service and even a bad work work culture there.

I find it rather rich that Elon is advising the US government on efficiency when ratings here are so low!I have had a Powerwall for two years. It has worked well hence two stars rather than one. I have the Tesla App on my android phone and android tablet.  Recently the latter stopped working. I found instructions online that appear to be out of date. They certainly didn't work for me.  I found a Tesla chat support service and entered a lot of information only to find it would not accept my post code. It appears to work only for those with a US zip code. I think I have signed into my Tesla account via my PC. Lots of ads but when I try to get into account settings, more ads and no access to settings.I emailed two days customer support two days ago and am still waiting for reply.C'mon Elon, this doesn't need rocket science.

By far the worst car company I have ever experienced.The company is set up to be an “everything is done online / on the App POS” - and if that’s what you like, great, however, the handover of the vehicle was shocking.It was literally abandoned in the middle of a car park and I was basically told, it’s over there.That was after my collection date was moved. It would be easier to get hold of the King than to get hold of anyone to speak to via the telephone phone at Tesla. And don’t even try to email them, emails are ignored until you mention complaint or financial ombudsman.

Went into Tesla to buy a vehicle put down $250 picked out my car gave all the information I needed to get approved came in the next day. They told me they didn’t run my credit but they’re sorry another sales person sold the vehicle . I was told that they would be sending me my 250 back. I went next-door and I bought a brand new Mustang mock E. Then I was told they ran my credit after I bought a car and they told me I didn’t get approved so now they’re keeping my 250. What a scam.

Tesla Northampton Absolutely Shambolic Service –  Should Be Avoided at All Costs!I am absolutely FUMING after my experience with Tesla Northampton. I sent my car in for service, expecting at least a basic level of professionalism, but what I got back was an absolute disgrace. Not only did my car return with MORE ERRORS than it had before, but it was also FILTHY – clearly not valeted, not even a basic wipe-down.The only thing Tesla Northampton seems to care about is their extortionate £165 per hour labour charge and getting their precious 5-star review – well, here's the TRUTH: their service is BELOW ANY STANDARD!Trying to speak to anyone about my concerns was an absolute joke. The place is like a GHOST TOWN – nobody to help, nobody to explain anything, just an empty showroom with zero accountability. The moment you've handed over your money, they couldn't care less.And let's talk about the bigger issue – if you buy a Tesla, you are basically LOCKED IN to Tesla service centres because there are barely any independent garages willing to touch these cars. So unless you want to be held hostage by Tesla's incompetence, DO NOT BUY A TESLA!I want my money back. This has been the worst customer experience I have ever had with any car manufacturer. Tesla might make fancy cars, but their service is abysmal, and I regret ever buying into the hype. Avoid at all costs!!!

Elon has onehandedly destroyed the brand- NO ONE will touch them, drive or being seen in one. It is effed!!!

Love the car but the communication is awful for delivery and service. Can’t wait to lease end…hopefully no surprises.

Avoid. the powerwall in the UK. The technical support is utterly useless.   Bought the powerwall 2 last July. Took nearly six months to get on the Octopus flux tariff. Then a big storm, and powerwall worked to give us power during outage. Then it went on the fritz. Hasn't worked since. Their customer care utterly useless. In nearly 2 months we've been given a reference number for our complaint and been told we've been 'escalated to tier 2' whatever that means. I can't think of any other company that has treated me with such contempt.

The imperialistic tendencies of GAFAM—those dominant American tech giants—are becoming harder to ignore and now extend to Tesla. The company, under Elon Musk’s leadership, has exhibited a similar arrogance that knows no bounds. I spent nearly $4,000 on the enhanced autopilot feature, only to have it disabled without just cause, allegedly for not paying enough attention while driving. This is utterly unfounded; Tesla’s algorithms are flawed. But Tesla presumes to know what’s best for you.Tesla, I demand a refund of the $4,000 I paid for this malfunctioning feature. We all need to be vigilant, as the next step will involve these algorithms preventing us from driving altogether. The company’s behaviour mirrors its CEO’s erratic tendencies.It’s high time for the European Union to investigate this scandal.

BRO! THE CYBER TRUCK LOOKS LIKE A MINE CRAFT CAR! IT LOOKS LIKE STEVE BUILT IT!!!!!

I’ve only had the car for 2 years and already the bluetooth won’t connect to my phone. The car is of a shoddy build and honestly i regret buying one - save yourselves the stress and buy a reputable brand! As i’ve seen multiple people comment here dealing with anyone at Tesla is a nightmare. Customer service read the same script and hang up on you when you try to ask them anything that deviates from their pre-learned script. The car delivery was a nightmare with the car being badly scratched when they gave me the keys!

Went to purchase a Tesla model 3. Filled in spec sheet on app was given a pcp monthly payment. I then went on to sign for finance and monthly payment had gone from £384 to £444.64.  I was shocked at jump in price, called Tesla and they blamed faulty prices on their site. Well 4 days later and after being told prices had been corrected, I was surprised to find out when I entered same specs I got the £384 price yet again. Please avoid these scammers as low price is used just to get deposit and then trap you in to a sale. For me I have refund and l am now looking to buy a BYD seal.

Good car. Customer service is abysmal. All departments are unhelpful, God help you if you run into any issues and require assistance. The customer service team will be of no help.

Never buy a Tesla, if you have any repairs issues, you have no choice but to use the Tesla repair centres, they are always busy & you can wait 2 weeks to book your car in, then the parts are never available, I had to wait a month for parts. Every time my car went in for a small repair for 1 or 2 days it ended up being in the service station for 4 to 8 weeks. Really badly organised. Again my car won't start/ no power so I have been waiting 4 days for technical team to do a remote diagnostics, keep being told they will get to it shortly, 3 days later asked again to be told they will get to it ASAP but they have a backlog! I've been left with no car & no idea when they will be able to run a diagnostic to check which parts need replaced so don't know if parts will be available! You cannot take it to any other garage to be repaired so the customer service staff are rude & direct & don't care if you are left without transport, which i rely on for work. Will sell as soon as it is repaired & won't buy another Tesla

If I would have known the REAL range of these cars, I wouldn't have purchased one.  I have a model 3 performance with a quoted range of 300 miles. I don't drive fast, I drive the speed limit on the highway, which is 75mph. The range testing was at 70 mph, so, ok, I figure I will lose a little because I'm going a little faster. Try losing 33% range.  I only get 208 miles of range, although Tesla tells me this is normal.  I would not recommend Tesla to my friends and family.

Tesla's focus seems to be solely on selling cars rather than ensuring a satisfying customer experience. My recent interactions with Tesla Service Centers have been extremely frustrating, and it’s clear that their service approach lacks empathy and practicality.Delivery Issues:When purchasing a new Tesla, the responsibility of inspecting the car for issues is placed entirely on the customer at the time of delivery. This expectation is unreasonable—how can the average customer, with no expertise in automotive inspection, be expected to identify issues? Most traditional dealerships ensure vehicles are thoroughly checked before delivery. Tesla seems to shift that burden onto its customers.Service Appointment Delays:If you miss reporting an issue during delivery, good luck trying to get it resolved. Booking a service appointment is a struggle, often with a wait time of at least a month. Even when you do secure an appointment, Tesla appears to prioritize minimizing their effort rather than resolving your concerns.Unfair Policies:Their service process is rushed and customer-unfriendly. You are required to pick up your car from the service center on the same day they notify you it’s ready—often conveniently at 5 PM, when the service center closes. Failure to retrieve the car by midnight incurs a $100 per day charge. This policy leaves no room to verify whether the issue has actually been resolved, which has happened to me on multiple occasions. I ended up picking up my car late at night, only to realize the problem persisted. The cycle of booking another appointment and waiting for weeks starts all over again.Specific Incident:My recent experience was particularly frustrating. My car produces a clunking noise during regenerative braking, audible only when the car is driven after long hours of being parked. I explained this issue in detail to the service representatives through the app, but they insisted that I reproduce the issue at drop-off. Given that Tesla's service center is over an hour away, this is impossible as the noise disappears after prolonged driving. Their refusal to consider this practical constraint demonstrates a lack of understanding and customer care.In summary, Tesla Service Centers appear to prioritize policies and procedures over genuinely resolving customer issues. While Tesla produces innovative vehicles, their service and customer support fall far short of industry standards. As a Tesla owner, I feel unsupported and frustrated by their lack of concern for customer satisfaction.

NEVER let Teslas or other EVs out into traffic (unless driving one yourself). You have to burn fuel to wait for them in your IC car and often slow down then speed up. The Tesla left waiting, however, creates no CO2 when not moving and won't have to slow down/speed up. I'm sure environmentally conscious Tesla owners won't mind at all if noone ever lets them into trafic. Its for the good of the planet after all.

I can't understand the fixation that few have about tesla. The aesthetics and features, to me, aren't worth the money for a tesla. The tesla rechargeable columns occupy precious spots at the mall that could be used for people with mobility deficiency instead. Aren't the electric cars bought to make less pollution? well then buyers can walk few meters more to make it to the mall entrance

Trying to return the Car at the end of a three year lease. Tesla choses Dekra for the handling of the return. The system is not working (after creating successfully an account, the system does not let you log in) and there is nobody to contact. When contacting Tesla they just state that this is an issue for the lease company, which funnily enough is Tesla. As a result, we are still having the car parked here, costing us insurance and presumably lease fees. Returns process is a buggy as the whole electrics in the car. No end of times could we not enter the car, as the fobs were not opening the car.

If I could give a minus I would.As we were buying a second Tesla they offered £1000 off the new vehicle.Signed all the docs and just before delivery a new set of documents appeared with the £1000 removed. After questioning this I was told it would be given as credits once I had taken delivery of the vehicle, as I was a lease customer.This was ok, so I took delivery of the new car, Surprise surprise, no credits appeared in my account. I chased them on the app, only for the conversation to be closed without answering my question.Opened a support ticket only to be completely ignored.Not only is this appalling, but the collection experience at Brent Cross was the worst I have ever experienced. Utter shambles, the Sales staff can’t even look you in the eye. Amateurish and belligerent.

Tesla trades user friendly features for sleek looking but non-intuitive usage. Very frustrating— feels like I have to study to learn how to drive it. The self-driving mode is terrifying. Used it briefly and it almost pulled in front of another car!  I also found out about the businesses extremely unethical practices (ie buying from suppliers who consistently abuse and exploit their employees). Instead, they look the other way. They even exploit children! There are so many reasons I will never buy a Tesla again.

As bad & pathetic as petulant child of the owner!

I want to clarify that this review is not about the car itself but about the company, specifically the purchasing process. This review is for Tesla Italy, where I purchased the car. Unfortunately, the assistance throughout the entire process was deeply disappointing. The showroom staff were unprepared, dismissive of client needs, and, at times, naively manipulative. Obtaining accurate information from them was nearly impossible, and the few details they provided turned out to be unreliable.Before delivery, I called the showroom and spoke to a dismissive representative who advised me not to expect much explanation during the handover, remarking that "Tesla is a software company." What he meant by this is beyond me. Sadly, he was right—the experience was terrible.The delivery site was a logistical nightmare—located far outside the city and nearly impossible to reach with public transportation. It resembled a scrapyard: a dilapidated shed filled with clutter, with car plates and documents seemingly unattended. The understaffed team struggled to manage the process, leaving clients waiting excessively. After a 45-minute wait, we were assisted by an employee (the only kind person in the experience) who was juggling multiple clients simultaneously.While inspecting the car, the staff member identified a defect and assured us that assistance would contact us in a few days to arrange for repairs. Three months later, we have yet to receive any follow-up. Frankly, given their disorganization, I wasn’t surprised.The car was delivered with an almost empty battery, and shockingly, no fast-charging stations were available at the Tesla delivery site. As it was late evening, we were forced to spend two hours on a slow charge before they "suggested" driving to a Supercharger 30 km away—otherwise, we wouldn’t have made it home.Recently, I’ve watched numerous videos showcasing new Chinese EVs, and given how competitive their products have become, I genuinely question why anyone would choose Tesla under these circumstances.

Impossible to talk to somebody about the finance arrangements. Placed an order paid the deposit but finance options are not what was presented on the website. Completely misleading and if we had known that would not have gone ahead. Spend 1.5 hours on hold and nobody answered the phone. Have requested a call back but not received one. Embarrassingly bad. I thought this was supposed to be a luxury product.

Great car but the Portuguese sales and delivery team are amateurs which made the entire buying process stressful and less than enjoyable.

They provided excellent service, and their guidance has generated great response. Customers can get truly great stuff from your service. You are the best, so keep it up and I say a thousand thanks.

I purchased a new Tesla in September 2023 with finance organised by Tesla with Black Horse Finance. Just tried to sell the to a dealer and the HPI check shows a second finance agreement with Mitsubishi Finance which pre-dates my purchase on the vehicle. Apart from selling me a new car with finance Agreement already attached to it I'm finding it impossible to contact them.

I bought my Tesla Model Y a year ago and my experience overall build quality is awful And suspension quality is awful while you drive in a bad road every corner of the cars is shacking and making weird noises it’s extremely bothering comfort is extremely low in bad roads it costed me over 60.000 dollars and this cars doesn’t deserve this money They could build with better suspensions

I’ve just had a power wall 3 and gate way 2 installed with a 5kw solar system could not be happier what a pice of kit once it’s up and running it’s so easy to use and adjust to your energy needs

Cancelled my Model 3 order due to unforeseen circumstances within the 14 day window. Almost a month later and they have still not refunded my £7000 deposit despite numerous calls, emails and messages, customer service simply doesn't bother to respond. I'd have considered another Tesla once circumstances allow but based on this experience I will be staying well away from the brand and won't be recommending them to anyone.

Great car, AWFUL customer service. The car showed delivery in September when I bought it. Then, every day, the 10-day delivery window moved back 1 day. Tesla only has email - no phone number. Email after email after email, no response. Eventually they get back to me and tell me the delay is because of the silver wheels and I can get the car within the week if I went with black. Would have been really helpful if they'd told me that weeks earlier rather than ignoring my communications. They finally give me a delivery date - November 1. The same day I move in to a new house: the main reason I bought the car, and desperately needed the car for that move. Now I've had to spend 4000dkk on a rental car for the move. And still no responses from Tesla, even though they promised to get back to me about compensation. Really, really bad customer support. I choose to lease as I wanted to buy once the new model Y comes out. Now I'll never buy a Tesla based on the terrible service and the staff that just don't care.

poor design, batteries low performance, low driving range. ...

Tesla 3 crashed iff road due to steering whell locking and no brakes working on highway. Luckily 4 passengers only minor injuries as by chance level field at side of road and no oncoming cars. Otherwise could have been 4 dead passengers. Worse was to come, Tesla totally nit interested in finding out why issue occurred, offered no apology, no compensation and were in fact totally uninterested that a famiky of 4 could be dead. Absolutely shamefull, no explanation!! Dont buy one if you vale your life cause Tesla certainly dont value it.

Went to Tesla Winchester today for my overnight test drive of a Model 3.  I had previously had multiple calls from Tesla to confirm that I would be coming.When I arrived, I was told the car was not available.  I asked why I had not been told by a telephone call in advance, but I was told they only just knew!!!!!I've just returned home having wasted hours of my time and having driven 80 miles for the test drive.I suppose Tesla believe a minute of their time is worth more than hours of mine.However, it is common courtesy to contact customers if the company cannot meet their commitment.My advice is, if you book a Tesla test drive, do not go unless you confirm before you leave that they have a car available, and get the name of the employee who confirms availability.

I have a Tesla lease. When I decided to move provinces I learn that the insurance company needs a form from Tesla Finance to be able to cancel the insurance in the first province. I have been trying to get this from them for 2 months. They won't respond so I'm stuck paying an extra $250 / month in insurance because they won't provide a simple document. No one will respond at all and there is no one to complain to. The only people at Tesla you can contact are sales people to sell you a car. When you need something after that you're on own. Goodbye! I'll never buy a Tesla again - because of the company, not the product.

Best motor (engine), but everything else is awful especially the service.- Car was sent in for warranty repair to suspension in June.- I was told suspension had been fixed, picked car up to find exact same loud creaking / crunching noise.- Sent the car back to be repaired- I was told suspension had been fixed, picked car up to find exact same loud creaking / crunching noise. This time with the rear seat left off with HV wires exposed and trim not replaced properly and now broken in the front (I have images etc).- I contacted in the app to say the suspension issue is still there, hasn't been fixed and that I would like to physically show the technician the noise so that they know what I am talking about (I sent three videos, but it didn't seem to help). But never received a reply.- Waited weeks for a reply, chasing daily, got nothing- Contacted complaints team, and that's when a manager came back to me to say she'd get it all sorted- New appointment was booked, but not much about the appointment makes sense, as per my email below. Haven't heard back since.

I'm not happy with the job they don for me they changed me to mach I they changed part not need to be changed they don't give me my old part back

Having collected my Tesla Y just over a month ago and getting used to the lack of Android connectivity e.g Android Auto and lack of decent maps and satnav without a subscription 😢 I have now discovered that there is no tyre inflation kit provided. It's an extra!!! Wow, 55k for a car and you need to buy a compressor as an extra. The tire warning came on after the 2nd day and has remained, but tesla said that the tires are fine at 39psi despite their own warning ⚠️ and the car saying they should be 42psi.

I BOUGHT TWO TV TESLA... WORKING GREAT

I recently went to Tesla to service my Model S which I have had for a few years and is now out of warranty. It is somewhat of a bizarre experience with a contactless process but decided to follow the app and do it the way they obviously wanted me to.I have to say the experience was incredibly smooth. It was a little unusual but it worked. The service was great, they carried out a number of repairs, door handles etc and all went well. The lounge at the service centre was great. Cannot find fault,

Elon is a genius but he needs to take a page from Jeff Bezos playbook and care more about their customers. They don’t give a crap about you. I bought a Cybertruck and it’s been creaking since I got it. They have delayed my service twice to fix it and are rude.

I had the absolute worst experience with Tesla, and I would never recommend them to anyone. I went to purchase a car and was given a conditional approval, which required me to trade in my current vehicle. Initially, they told me my monthly payment would be $385, and then they said it would drop to $348 if I traded in my car. However, after I agreed to the trade, the payment suddenly jumped to $448!It’s impossible to reach anyone on the phone. They rarely respond to messages, and when they do, it’s two hours after you’ve already sent them. The lack of customer service and clear communication is beyond frustrating. Tesla is completely unreliable, and it feels like they are just playing with your money.They are full of empty promises and have made what should be an exciting experience an absolute nightmare. Save yourself the headache and stay away from this company!

I’ve called customer support for supercharge available in a location I was 3 hrs from home I couldn’t locate one on my car I spoke with Peter how was so unhelpful & rude didn’t want to help location the closest supercharge to me but continue to say let me teach you some education in how to find it yourself!!!I know how to find a charge point close to me but I wanted help from TESLA SUPPORT if the could find me something better which the younger support staff have and made my journey much easier. But this PETER had no interest in helping me. I was travelling with my child and it was very late every change point I went to was either not work or didn’t exist. I eventually got help from a petrol STN staff.THANK YOU FOR THE WORST SERVICE TODAY PETER YOU NEED TO RELOCATE YOUR JOB IN TEACHING CHILDREN AS THATS ALL YOU SEEN TO DO IN THE CONVERSATION!!!!!!

Rude customer service, misleading information on website. You are unable to talk to anyone, they wont return emails and you could be getting your app removed from your phone leaving you with no access to the vehicle controls. Tesla is by far the worst car company I have ever dealt with. #STAY AWAY #GO ELSEWHERE

I was excited to join the Tesla community, but my experience with their service department has been deeply disappointing. Something as routine as an impacted rim causing a tire leak led to a 72-hour wait for a replacement. It’s baffling that such a common issue couldn’t be resolved quicker, especially when sourcing parts from another service location should be easy. To make matters worse, no loaner vehicle was offered, leaving me stranded during the wait.The service center itself is the epitome of poor customer service—rude attitudes, an unwelcoming atmosphere, and a lack of knowledge from the staff. With everything being cloud-based and supposedly accessible at their fingertips, I expected more competence and efficiency. Unfortunately, Tesla’s service department has underdelivered at every turn. After this third unresolved issue, I’m left highly disappointed and will be looking for another provider. Tesla has fallen short of its promises, and I can no longer trust them to meet basic service needs.

I was very excited to order my Tesla and went ahead and put a deposit down. Customer service was good at the beginning. When I had questions about financing and wanted to talk to an advisor, I was unable to get ahold of anyone through multiple calls and texts. Shemaiah was my initial advisor and she just ghosted me. I will lose my deposit now because I can't get the questions I have answered. For such a superior product, their customer service is lacking and extremely unprofessional.

At around 3.30 this afternoon my husband contacted Tesla via the App to report a serious steering fault in our Model X. It is too dangerous to drive it so we need roadside assistance. Meanwhile, it’s now 9.05 pm and we have still not got beyond Step 1 on the App (our request for assistance has been acknowledged but no action taken at all yet). At around 4.30 pm I called the AA who arrived in 30 minutes but the verdict was that we needed Tesla roadside assistance to take it to be repaired as it’s (unsurprisingly) an electrical fault. I don’t think that in 40 years of driving I’ve ever experienced a worse response to a roadside emergency…

Product is garbage, tech support is nonexistent, call for support you will be waiting for hours on end for someone to pick up and once they do they will give you contradictory info from previous techs.

I bought a Tesla and when I had problems I tried to solve them by calling Tesla CS. Two people there ended my call, one was completely rude and I had to argue with them to help me with my problems. This is not what I expected from TESLA. They should fire most of their employees in Dublin or cut their salaries because they are completely useless and not easy to get help from. I hope Elon gets informed how bad his customers are giving their reviews.

My Tesla wall connector has developed a fault and would not charge my Tesla car anymore. I thought it would be straight forward matter as the product was still under warranty. I went on to the Tesla app and followed the instruction to try to get the matter resolved. It was tedious but I was OK to go along. Little did I know that I was about to embark on a nightmare journey. There was little support, rather I was asked to provide all kind of checking results. There was a lot of back and forth by emails without knowing if there was a real person at the other end. They asked for all the minor details even down to the complete wiring scheme of the wall connector. I am not an electrician and the connector was installed by a Tesla recommended company. I suggested Tesla to send someone out to inspect the connector themselves in order to confirm that the devise was truly faulty. There was no reply, no response, complete radio silence. This matter is still unresolved and I still can't use the wall connector. It is quite an eye opener about how Tesla treats its customers.

I recently spoke with Tesla representative 'Ingrid' regarding an update on my order, and I couldn't be more pleased with the experience. Ingrid was incredibly professional, providing detailed and thorough information that addressed all my questions. Her friendly demeanor made the conversation enjoyable, and I truly felt valued as a customer.Thanks to Ingrid, my experience with Tesla has been enhanced significantly. I appreciate her help and dedication!

Shocking customer experience, you can't get to speak to anyone, I was trying to buy three cars and it was so difficult.  I have been in the motor business for 40 years and this was the worst experience I have ever had.  I hope this is not the future.  I won't be buying or recommending Tesla....just shocking

Misleading Sales Practices and Poor Customer SupportI went to Tesla with the intention of purchasing a Model 3, only to discover later that I had been signed into a lease agreement instead. Despite repeatedly expressing that I wanted to buy the car, Tesla misled me, never clarifying the lease. Worse yet, they refused to let me convert the lease to a purchase after I realized the mistake. I was forced to return the car and go through the entire process again, losing non-refundable deposits and incurring unnecessary fees.To make matters worse, I had made it clear I needed the car for ride-sharing, only to learn later that Tesla’s leased vehicles cannot be used for this purpose. I contacted Tesla several times to resolve the issue, but they offered no solution, leaving me frustrated and out of pocket.If you're considering Tesla, beware of their misleading sales practices and lack of transparency. They seem more interested in pushing deals through than actually ensuring customer satisfaction.

I recently had a frustrating experience with Tesla service. After booking a back glass replacement a month in advance, I traveled two hours and booked a hotel, only to be told at 6 pm the night before that my car couldn’t be serviced the next morning. I was advised to reschedule in two weeks closer to my house, with no guarantee it wouldn’t happen again.While the staff was polite, there was no flexibility on a resolution beyond, “there’s nothing we can do” and “we didn’t make you book the hotel,” which is true. But the lack of alternatives—especially after spending significant money on prior services—was disappointing. For a company like Tesla, I expected more reliability and consideration for customer investment.I would love for Tesla to handle this service and all future services, but currently considering other options. I’m used to traditional dealership service from Toyota, but not sure if I want to continue paying what seems to be the traditional dealership premium while receiving less-than-dealership quality service.

Bought a used Model X and love it!!!Minimal unexpected maintenance costs. Regular updates on the app.Service appointments in Scotland are not as great as the Exceptional Milton Keynes Branch.I wish there was a Service Centre in Inverness as good as Milton Keynes. Save me having to drive to Milton Keynes to get my car serviced, which is not very often.The only niggle. I wish there were more multiple charge points in Scotland. Fraserburgh, Elgin, Golspie, Wick, and Ullapool would be the locations which would destroy the awful CPS/Swarco offering in one swoop.Love you Tesla.Please please please lobby the Government to get rid of Swarco get the funding you need to create an Awesome charging infrastructure in Scotland.

It's hard to describe how bad the Tesla Service process is.Tiny queries and questions take forever. The team can only be contacted via the fiddly App. The fiddly App is barely fit for purpose. It requires your address and yet when you try to enter the address it will not find it (unless you happen to live in New York or maybe number 10 Downing street).Good luck with getting a reply from Tesla. It's patchy at best and most of the time they will come back with a further question and certainly not the answer you're looking for - which will add another few hours to the process.Parts are very hard (impossible) for regular mechanics to get hold of, so the driver has to request via the app. Unless the driver happens to also be a mechanic then good luck, because there will be questions!!The only chance anyone has of getting anything done is to book an appointment at a Tesla service centre. There aren't many, so get ready for a drive. The most recent booking I just made was a disaster. First they have limited appointments, then they send me a quotation to "approve". The quotation was around 10 times what I expected because they added parts covering every eventuality, including many hours at £165/hr to fit them all. The approval system doesnt work for me - it just takes me to my app which has no information, so i had to request a manual email with attachment. Got there after a few hours. Of course Tesla then say they don't know how long the fix will take, and say it will "most likely roll over into the next day". They do not provide a courtesy car (apparently only available on warranty repairs), and suggested i book one of their vehicl test drives on the same day, and use that. I have a 2 hour journey to get home so I need to find some way of getting there. No idea whether they are expecting me to take the vehicle home, but also no way of asking as there are no numbers you can reach Tesla Bristol on.

I am trying to replace a headlight on my Tesla model S and am having very difficult time with services. I started this process in July and I got an appointment for August. One week before the appointment I got an estimate for $770. I had to  cancel that appointment  and when I went to reschedule I was directed to another service center. A month later they provided an estimate for the same job for $2200. So super high for a bulb/headlight setup replacement. I cancelled that appointment dud to price but now I cannot get any appointments at the “cheap” $770 location. On line I am reading that someone was given a $3600 estimate for a headlight replacement. Why is there such a range of pricing for a necessary repair provided by Certified Tesla service centers? 770 - $3600 is a 500% difference. Why is Tesla not allowing contact with all service centers but is limiting  owners by their algorithms which dictate where can one go for a service? I have to drive and charge 2 times on a way to get a bulb replacement  and  I don’t have a choice to call  a service center directly or choose to which service center to go. Rather, I depend  on Tesla algorithm with restrictions and limitations. Being a Tesla owner is very frustrating when one needs service. I must say thus far the service that we have had was fairly priced, this is the first item the tag seems outrageous. Last year our entire Tesla computer system was changed and we paid $2200 - is the headlight with a burned bulb an equivalent value or work to Tesla computer system? How many Tesla owners are willing and able to pay 2-3 K for a headlight replacement where a bulb replacement would do.  Many of us are driving Tesla not as an income statement but because we want to protect the earth for children and their children. It would be great if Tesla would provide access to their service centers and pricing on line and if they would make sure that there is no 500% price difference for the same job among Tesla Service centers to which they direct us.

The Future of cars.

I had the worst experience with Tesla, particularly at their Stockport showroom, and I feel compelled to share it. On August 11th, I visited the showroom for a used car event after receiving an invitation. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a complete disaster.Upon arrival, there was no one to greet or assist me. After waiting for 10 minutes, I noticed a Tesla employee, Marcello, outside. When I waved to get his attention, he briefly pointed out three used cars that were on sale and didn’t even offer a test drive or to unlock the cars for a closer look. Despite this, I was interested in a Tesla Model Y, but instead of letting me inspect the car, Marcello insisted I put down a £200 deposit. I expressed concern about the non-refundable nature of the deposit, but Marcello assured me that since I was local and buying from the Stockport showroom, the deposit would be refundable if I changed my mind.Unfortunately, I was unable to secure a reasonable trade-in value for my current car and decided not to proceed with the Tesla purchase. On August 19th, I informed Marcello of my decision, and he assured me that my deposit would be refunded. He even sent a message saying, "The order has been cancelled and the refund process has started. It just needs to be approved, which should happen in a few hours. The money should be back with you within 10-14 working days."Fast forward to August 30th, and the refund still hadn’t been processed. I sent Marcello a polite message inquiring about the refund and received a shocking reply from Tesla stating, "The deposit is non-refundable as per the order agreement. No refund has been processed." This was completely contrary to what Marcello had assured me.I tried to resolve the issue by calling Tesla’s contact number, but it was a nightmare. After waiting 35 minutes, I finally spoke to someone named Jay, who was utterly unhelpful. He informed me that Marcello was working but refused to assist me further, simply telling me to wait for Marcello to call back without any guarantee of when that would happen. Frustrated, I called again later and spoke with Tilda, who was slightly more helpful. She confirmed that Marcello and his showroom manager were off that day, but she would try to process the refund. Despite her promises, I heard nothing back.By August 31st, after several follow-ups, I still had no response. I'm now planning to visit the Stockport store in person to address this issue face-to-face.This experience has been utterly disgusting. I’ve always wanted to buy a Tesla Model Y and was initially excited about the prospect. However, after dealing with this incompetent and unresponsive team, I’m relieved I didn’t go through with the purchase. If their customer service is this abysmal before buying a car, I can’t imagine what it would be like if something went wrong with the vehicle.Save yourself the headache and avoid Tesla Stockport at all costs. They are nothing but a group of thieves with zero regard for their customers.

I have a model 3 long-range, and it is by far the best car I have ever had. I feel like living in the future. It is not perfect, as the suspension is too hard, but overall it beats every other cars by a lot. And man, 490 HP instant and continuous acceleration on four wheels rocks! I cannot get used to that.

Ordered wall charger in app. No info provided on availability or delivery.  Tesla took the money immediately anyway. Customer service seems designed to be almost impossible to meaningfully interact with. When did get one line reply: rude and unhelpful. And shut down chat. Cancelled. Ordered from Amazon.

Dear Mr. Musk I have now had a least a dozen of heart attacks, when driving with my husband in our Tesla Model 3 Highlander. Here is an example: driving on the road with the auto pilot and the car suddenly breaks and goes from 80 to 50 km/h, because the car sees an obstacle on the side of the road - not on the road which would make sense - but on the side.On the highway it’s the same - but here it could be a bridge, a truck driving on the lane next to us or a car parked in the emergency lane. Besides that I love our Tesla - but please please fix this problem before an accident happens. Love from a frustrated Dane

Worst customer service. We lost a load of money not only on the car but due to issues with the car. Even if car is in manufacturer warranty, they refuse to pay and claim accidental damage for mechanical issues

Disappointing Service and Lack of Accountability at Tesla KastrupI have been a loyal Tesla customer for years, but my recent experience with the Tesla Service Center in Kastrup, Denmark, has been deeply disappointing. Despite reporting an unusual noise in my Model S over a year and a half ago while it was still under warranty, Tesla dismissed my concerns. Now, with my car out of warranty, I’ve been told the motor needs to be replaced—at my expense.On top of that, a costly battery replacement (100,000 DKK) was necessary immediately after my warranty expired. When I tried to discuss these issues with the supervisor, Henrik, I was met with an uncooperative attitude and no assistance in resolving my concerns.To make matters worse, when I asked for help accessing service history comments in the Tesla App, I was told it wasn’t their responsibility, despite my right to this information. This lack of transparency and accountability has severely impacted my trust in Tesla. I’m hoping for a resolution, but so far, no response to my formal complaint.If this is how Tesla handles issues, I’m concerned for their commitment to customer service.

Our roof solar system has been down for 11 days now and Tesla is unresponsive. Their service wait time is two to three weeks as they cannot bother with staffing properly.  Why invest in Tesla Solar? Musk is too busy "politicking" instead of managing his businesses.

One of the worst customer service experiences I ever had overall

Anyone who has one of these glorified skates should be ashamed that they are lining the pockets of such a deranged creature.

I wish there were a “0” star option. I bought a used car and Tesla insisted that they will do the paperwork for my license plate. They didn’t. I am driving on an expired license plate and there is hardly anyone I can get on the phone. I had to call the police department and DMV to figure this out. The car is great and the service absolutely sucks. Like out of an SNL skit.

Zero customer service, zero communication.  Avoid Charlotte Tesla AT ALL COSTS.  Don't make the same mistake we did.

My Model Y was allegedly written off in May 2023. It has unbeknown to me repaired and has been charged twice at my expense. Tesla are refusing to refund me the cost as they say it’s still registered to me.

Not worth giving them even one star. I wish there must be ZERO STAR in here. Waiting long to fix small things, Poor service. Try avoid these cars.

Don't even think of buying Tesla cars; they don't provide after-service; they are looters.

I am at tesla service center for 7hours for windshield replacement and now they damaged the body of my brand new car. I said i am going to complain this and manager told me you can do whatever you want. It is insane i do not recommend anyone to purchase tesla.

I am disappointed to have to write a negative review before I even take delivery of a Tesla. Whilst it's clear to me that Tesla have, by and large, an excellent product, it is equally clear that important aspects of their customer service fall very short of what might be acceptable, let alone excellent.  For a tech-forward company that has had a considerable number of years to hone its customer facing processes, I was shocked to find that significant aspects of the pre-purchase and delivery processes are not well integrated, leading to an underwhelming customer experience and falling well short of my average expectations. My complaints fall into the following categories:Finance deals available via the Tesla app/website are not actually available from their finance partner (Santander).  I was, for example, unable to apply for a 12 month initial rental personal contract hire deal with Santander, even though Tesla was happy to take an order on that basis in their app.Finance approval took an inordinate amount of time by modern standards, with Santander taking 4 days to approve my application and an indeterminate amount of time thereafter to file “paperwork” with Tesla. Tesla will fix but then unilaterally move delivery dates.  They understandably need finance to have been approved before delivery but once approved, they then introduced a new hurdle, advising that they needed to await the receipt of “paperwork” from Santander before they could release the car, introducing additional collection delays.  In total (so far) they have moved my delivery (collection) date 3 times, the last two of which were without prior consultation.  This has caused me genuine inconvenience and expense.Let’s hope things get better henceforth.

I bought Tesla solar for my house after a great experience buying a Tesla vehicle, and because I was shopping for solar panels anyway. The purchase was made in late 2023 and the install happened around March. Finally, in April everything went live.I noticed immediately that the wiring seemed off and certain appliances started to trip on the breaker panel. Our fridge would suddenly be turned off, and we'd notice it was due to the breaker Tesla installed. We replaced the breaker at our own expense.Next, we noticed the Tesla app stating the house was using 0 kw for the entire house anytime the air conditioning came on. This obviously makes no sense and it couldn't be true. This resulted in our system reporting more electricity being sold back to the grid than we were actually selling back. I contacted Tesla about this and they claimed that my system was running fine on their end, and they showed no errors in my configuration. I kept telling them they needed to send someone out but they initially refused, unless I paid $300 service call fee. At some point about week later, Tesla then emailed me saying my system shows signs of errors and they need to send someone out. Someone first came out in early June. They claimed the system was running fine, but that I needed a new unit that housed the fan (but that the fan couldn't be replaced alone, they'd have to replace the entire unit--I forgot the name he called it). During that visit, I showed the Tesla technician the app and what it reported when the AC came on. He claimed it was an app issue and if I logged out and deleted the app and reinstalled it, it would be fixed. I did this and it didn't work. He scheduled another technician to come out in late June to replace the unit. When this technician came, he claimed there was an issue with the Tesla system and that he addressed it. He told me that he would call me the next day to check that it was fixed and he did not. The issues remained.By now, I'm getting bills from my electricity company (TEP) with major discrepancies compared to what the Tesla app shows that I'm selling back to the grid and using etc. I then received a very high electricity bill for $274, the same amounts I would receive in the summer here in Arizona if I had no solar panels. At this I was infuriated because I'm paying a similar amount for the solar panels and my expectation was that it would drastically reduce my bills (this being the 3rd month being live).I then went back on the Tesla app and chatted with service for help. I told them the entire story. I asked Tesla to reimburse me for the months that I've been paying for solar panels without them working properly. I explained the new issues to Tesla. 1. The fridge in my house is still randomly tripping off on the panel (this started happening after the solar installation)2. The app still shows that the home is using 0 kW at times when that is clearly not the case. It usually does this when the Air Conditioner comes on. 3. At night, the system is falsely showing that it receives energy from the sun. It is charging my Tesla vehicle and it should only be charging on solar (above 45%). It charges at night somehow because the system falsely says it is receiving solar energy in the middle of the night.4. At times it shows the home is using 7.7 kW while no major appliances are on (i.e. the AC, which usually is responsible for driving up the power usage). Then when the AC comes on the kW being used actually drops significantly to 1.2 kW. Tesla told me that I need a Whole Home Cycle, or reboot for the system. The process was emailed to me and I was told to wait 24 hours to see if the problems persisted. The problems persisted. I then asked Tesla again to  send someone out and rewire the system, and investigate this properly. I asked also for a refund of months paid, because in essence they've sold me a defective product. Tesla refused, saying they don't reimburse in such instances. I told them they need to either fix the problem, or take the panels off and cancel the purchse and provide a refund. They now have said they're sending more technicians over on 7/24/24 to invetigate the issue. Meanwhile, the system is still faulty. I have no idea of how much energy I'm actually using and what's being sold back to the grid. The system says I'm generating solar in the middle of the night without the sun. This is what I would expect from a very amateur and scammish company, not Tesla. Highly disappointed in the service and the product's functionality. I hope Tesla responds here and gets this addressed. Otherwise, I hope this thread warns and stops people from buying Tesla solar until they fix this very known issue.

While I love my Tesla, my experience with Tesla service has not been a positive one.  I had to drive 4 hours to the closest service center for Tesla to look at my suspension for the 4th time in 18mos.  They have done 4 alignments in 18mos and won’t fix the issue with the suspension.  And I arrived before 5pm when I dropped off the car for a loaner, and the service center was locked up and not a soul in sight.  I then had to wait 20min for a Uber who got sideswiped when we were on I-25 which sent us into the railing.  I would have been much safer in the loaner I was promised while my car was in for service.  Overall, Tesla needs to expand its service centers, provide loaners until 5pm on a weekday especially when driving 4hrs from Colorado to drop off the car, and needs to fix the suspension and stop having me pay a small fortune in alignments which do not remedy the issue.

Absolutely love the cars but the customer service is atrocious. My Model Y was new in December 2023 today (July) I have noticed the drivers window has several large cracks in the inner pane that have suddenly appeared. The car is possibly safe to drive as it is a double glazed unit but I am concerned the pane may shatter internally onto me. There are no mobile appointments available on the app and the first service centre appointment is in 24 days. I spoke to a very rude gentleman in the roadside assist number as it was the only human I could speak to after spending nearly an hour ringing lots of different Tesla numbers. He told me I needed to take the car to a service centre, couldn't seem to understand that I don't feel safe driving it. Eventually he told me to repair it myself!!! My warranty is 4 years which includes defective parts. As far as I am concerned the window is a part and it is defective otherwise it wouldn't have cracked on the inside with no impact. I am now in the position of having to pay Autoglass either £240 going through my insurance company which will have further implications or £1,124 if I pay it myself. Apparently if I get a report from a glass installer saying it is defective then I may have some recompense via Tesla but who do I even send the report, photos and receipt to? Tesla are great cars but the customer service is beyond bad it is literally non existent. A £60k car and you are pretty much left on your own once you drive it away. Tesla PLEASE SORT THIS OUT!!!

Tesla Model S windscreen wipers failed - car undrivable. Took a week to get an appoint which was then cancelled.  Now waiting another week so that's 2 weeks without a car.I don't seem to be able to buy the part myself so I'm stuck.  Not to mention the rear passenger door handle is also broken (a well know issue which Tesla should have done a recall on) which is going to cost me another £450.Car has to go.  I need reliable transport which can be fixed quickly when required.Shame.JA.

I bought Model Y last year. The fuel savings have gone wasted with aggressive price cuts within 6 months. I contacted them many times to compensate me, no positive responses. It’s now $10,000 cheaper. So many Teslas now on the streets, don’t buy if you want a good resale vale. Better to buy a hybrid car. I got 3 of them and fuel cost for me is same as charging EV.

Within two years, all the warning lights on my Tesla Y (2022) started to light up.Regenerative braking, ABS, traction control, etc., nothing worked anymore, and the car became unsafe.I had to wait over a month for an appointment, and today was finally my turn.At the Tesla service center in Örebro, Sweden, I had to wait over 8.5 hours for my car to be ready.I did not receive a rental car because my car would be ready the same day.Very poor service, very rude staff.Although the car is generally really okay, I will never buy a Tesla again because of the problems you will get when something is wrong.I will be selling my car as soon as possible.

I ordered a car which had an end of quarter deal at 399 for a Model Y. Everything was sorted and my car was selected and I was ready to pick it up.Next thing they said my cars ready to pick up from London when I'm in Manchester. I asked them to change it somewhere closer so they changed it to Manchester.Next thing I call them up with a few questions around things like does the car have Matrix lights.10 minutes later I have a new notification on my tesla app saying my finance has been approved when it's already been approved before at 399.When I look at my app it changed the monthly payments to 690 pounds per month!!!!They told me I didn't pick up my car within the quarter so tough luck we aren't honoring it.Biggest problem is nowhere in my contract I signed says that I had to pick up the car before the deal ended.So they sold me a car contract for a lease with a deposit I put down but didn't have a car ready for me which makes it impossible to fulfill the obligation they set along with how many others.The funniest part is when calling support to make a complaint she knew exactly the situation like it was a regular occurance. Really looked forward to finally being able to get a tesla and this has been a devastating experience and a let down.

Dear Tesla Customer Service,I am writing to express my extreme disappointment and frustration with the customer service and delivery process for my new Tesla Model S Plaid.When I placed my order, I was informed that the delivery would take approximately two weeks. However, it took an astonishing two months, with the scheduled delivery date being June 30th.On the day of the scheduled delivery, I received a call just one hour before my pick-up time, notifying me that my vehicle had not arrived at the designated location. I was told that the car was stuck three hours north of the pickup point and was reassured it would be delivered to my home by 7 PM that evening.I spent the entire day eagerly waiting at home, excited to receive my new vehicle. By 8 PM, it became clear that the car was not going to arrive. I attempted to contact the number that had reached out to me earlier, but received no response.The following day, I tried to respond to the text message, as advised, but again received no reply. I also attempted to reach out through the Tesla app and called the delivery location multiple times, navigating through the phone menu options to no avail. The lack of communication was highly unprofessional and deeply frustrating.To my dismay, I later noticed an update in the Tesla app, rescheduling my delivery to July 5th. Unfortunately, I will be traveling for the holiday and cannot make this appointment. Despite my attempts to communicate this issue via text, the Tesla app, and multiple phone calls, I have received no response.I am extremely dissatisfied with this entire experience, especially considering the significant investment in a vehicle that costs over $100,000. The lack of communication and the repeated delays are unacceptable and have left me deeply disappointed.I request immediate attention to this matter and a resolution that ensures prompt and reliable delivery of my vehicle. I also expect an explanation for the poor service and what measures Tesla will take to prevent such issues in the future.

For some reason Tesla is a love them or hate them brand. Most people LOVE them. I drive an M3 and after a couple minor warranty repairs in the first month, I have been in dreamland owning this thing for almost 2 years. No reason to ever drive another car brand the rest of my life due to their self driving capability.

The worst company ever won't even return my calls. Trying to get services, six weeks out to get an appointment. No way to talk directly to a person.

Tesla Model 3 2021, battery failed after 17900 miles, still under warranty, warning alert that "max charge and range maybe reduced, ok to drive, book service soon". Booked service request, told wating for parts, 1 month later still waiting for parts which turns out to be a new HV battery pack. Max charge dropped to 70% then 39% and refusing to charge, car unusable and been unable to use for work and need a car to get to the airport in 2 weeks. Trying to sort a loan car from Tesla but no one cares, no service or support. Given run around through endless telephone menus. Shocking. Given the issues we've had with the 3 Tesla's the business purchased we won't be buying new Tesla's when the lease is up in a years' time unless they do something amazing to sort out this mess. Shouldn't expect this after only 17k miles but apparently reading online a widespread problem...

Terrible experience! After waiting a month for my brand new car, I drove an hour to the dealership just for them to tell me it has a large deep scratch (but they can paint over it if I take it to a 3rd party). I wasn’t offered a discount or even an apology, so I refused delivery. I have to wait over a month for another “new” car but here is the kicker - they changed my APR financing terms! Even though this whole ordeal is Tesla’s fault, I’m now paying more for my car and waiting longer for it to arrive. Nobody in customer service helps. Bridgeville location is the absolute worst. Everyone insists on going in the back to talk to the “manager” that probably doesn’t even exist. Terrible experience so far , and the worst customer service I’ve ever had.

I am deeply disappointed with Tesla's customer service. Despite waiting for two weeks, when Chris finally contacted me, he offered no help and just made excuses. My Tesla car has been sitting unused for over two weeks due to a faulty charger, and I still haven't received a replacement. I had to go to the store and spend 40 minutes on a call with no solution. This is the worst service I've ever experienced.To make matters worse, I've been waiting for six weeks for a replacement charger with no end in sight. The lack of urgency and efficiency from Tesla UK's customer service team is shocking. This whole experience has left me feeling upset and regretful for ever trusting Tesla. If Tesla's management sees this review, I want them to know that I'll be sharing my story on social media to warn others about their poor service.

Telsa's customer service is getting worse every year! Telsa has decided to close many Tesla service centers in the UK and ask customers to drive to another city (e.g. from Reading to Guildford) to get service. If Tesla continues to cut costs, they may ask customers to drive to another country or to the factory to have their cars repaired!By the way, Tesla has failed to fix many of my car's problems over the past 18 months, including poor 4G connectivity and malfunctioning windshield wipers. Buying Telsa was a mistake and it is getting worse!

i have model Y 2024 it is not comfortable suspension is bad seats not comfortable enough. sound system not refined or good control tablet subpar.  inside looks and feels when driving like a glorified golf  cart. materials features and feel has the snell of cheapness stay away

Love my Model Y but my experience with their customer service/dealer service leads me to not recommending anyone to purchase from Tesla. Would give them zero star if I could. When I picked up SUV, it was filthy on the outside. I made them wipe down the entire SUV before I took ownership. Inside was not prepped either. Day one had a front trunk (frunk) faulty sensor failure warning. Really annoying triple beep every 3 seconds telling me about the sensor failure. Asked if they could turn it off until I could get this fixed, but said they said no. Took 6 weeks to get that repaired. Gave me a loaner Model S during repair and it was absolutely filthy inside and out.Bought their sunshade for roof of SUV. It was a very poor fit and was just a mesh, not any material that could reflect the sunlight. Returned and bought one on Amazon that fit perfectly and provides better protection from the sun and the heat it generates.Noted a crack on sidewall of one of the brand new Pirelli's and Tesla told me it looks like an impact that caused crack. Not true, never hit or scraped tire on curb, etc. Local tire store will help me submit a claim, Tesla won't help due to "privacy policy", i. e., they don't want to help. Don't even think you can easily call and talk to a person. They don't want to talk to you, rely on text/email. Really disappointed in their service after the sale and just hope I don't have to deal with them ever again. Will get tires rotated at a local shop. I don't want to give them another penny.

Horrific experience if you need to change something or basically do anything that requires talking to a person.  I should have guessed that the most tech forward car would have the worst customer service.  I hate my Tesla and it hasn’t even arrived yet.  It was supposed to be delivered but instead I’m being told to pick it up 500 miles away.  No one responds. No one answers phones.  Customer service is non existent.  Worse than my bank X 100. I miss people answering phones. Young people will never know how the world was.  Makes me love my 1972 Chevy truck. Time will tell

I have been trying for two months to determine why my Wall Charger won't charge on demand. I have spoken with many advisor, all of whom failed to solve the problem. I finally arranged to have a home visit which Tesla cancelled today. When I called to complain I spoke with Hector who discovered that I was missing a key feature within my phone app... the Wall Charger page. After locating that and turning off scheduled charging within that section of the app the charger now works properly on demand. Hector is a genius with the patience of Job. He deserves a raise.

After a visit in Tesla service Arhus, i am very disapointed, i payd 5800 kr for nothing, the car is exactly the same like before service.

I am still trying to buy a car. There is no customer service. I am stuck as they don’t believe in picking up the phone and talking to customers, everything is supposed to be done on the Tesla app which does not perform the job. A simple old fashioned picking up the phone and talking to the customer would have done the trick - oh no that is too dated for Tesla. I give 0 stars for customer services.Seriously considering cancelling my order and forgo the £200 rather than have to deal with the endless voiceless computer chats. I hope Tesla understands that talking to customers is not outdated process.

The car is amazing and I am super happy wit that.So irritating that I bought a  model Y standard range on February and now it is 15.000 kr cheaper on tesla.com

Great car! love my Model Y

I attempted to secure the 2-year 1.8%APR lease plan for Model Y in March. I placed an order on 25th March with the help of Tesla advisor Gemma in Milton Keynes. The car must be delivered by the end of March in order to secure this offer.The whole leasing process is supposed to be finished through the Telsa mobile app. However, the monthly payment figures I obtained in the app was different from the one that promoted in their web site. The advisor never helped on the issue and when calling their support line, they kept saying returning my call later but never called back. After spending 2-3 weeks to seek help from different channels in Tesla, I never got a formal response about the issue and they were relucant to refund.Finally I had to contact Citizens Advice and wrote a formal complaint letter to their resolution team to get back my order fee.Tesla customer team is infamous about their service but I never think of such a painful experience even for leasing a car! They have cutting edges for their electric vehicles. However, their customer service team has plenty space for improvement if they want to dominate the EV industry.New buyers can only pray that everything goes smooth. Otherwise, do not expect any support from their customer service team.

I am writing to express my concerns and seek a reevaluation regardingthe refusal of warranty coverage for a windshield crack in my8-month-old Tesla Model Y, which I believehas not been handled in accordance with the high standards of customerservice and product quality expected from Tesla.On the morning of 18 April 2024, I discovered a crack on thewindshield of my vehicle, which had been parked overnight in theenclosed parking area of my residence. There was no evidence ofexternal impact or damage when I parked the car the evening before.Concerned, I brought the vehicle to the Tesla Service Center in Tuzla,Istanbul, for a thorough inspection.At the service center, Mr. Sezer and his team conducted a detailedexamination and confirmed that there were no signs of external impactor debris collision on the windshield. Despite this, the decision wasmade not to cover the repair under warranty. It was suggested that thecrack could not have developed without an external cause, even thoughno such cause was evident.The team also mentioned that the nature of the crack did not suggestit was due to stress or a manufacturing/assembly defect. However, Ibelieve this conclusion may have overlooked possible latent defects orunusual stress fractures that could occur without external impact,especially given the age and condition of the vehicle.Given Tesla's reputation for quality and customer care, this decisionis unexpectedly disappointing and seems inconsistent with theprinciples of fairness and customer satisfaction. It is dishearteningto face such a significant repair issue so early in ownership, notattributed to any misuse or external damage on my part.Therefore, I kindly request a reevaluation of this decision. I believefurther investigation may be necessary to explore all possible causesof the windshield crack under warranty provisions. It is important forme, as a customer, to feel supported and valued, especially inunexpected situations like this that question the integrity of myvehicle.Thank you for your attention to this matter. I am hopeful for aresolution that upholds the esteemed standards of Tesla and reinforcesmy confidence in your products and services.

The car is great , customer service is the worst. They are robots machines , who think everyone is stupid and we must have a phd in Tesla. Very rude people.

Just picked up my new vehicle and overall the team has  been really helpful with setting everything up and helping get my rebates etc thanks to all the tesla team out there that goes above and beond to assist me.

I had a power wall 2 installed in February and can’t only report 5 star performance and ease of use.I’m surprised to see so many poor reviews for this brand, maybe I got lucky?

My experience was good. Took delivery of the Model Y long Range car last year August 2023 ( Dortmund )

Absolutely horrible experience, never again.

Have a model 3 2021 LR absolutely fantastic car.Yes had a few problems but service in Northampton tesla impeccable no quibbles on warranty work.Fantastic over the air updates as you need them.Looking forward to model 3 ludicrous coming soon.

I bought my first Tesla, a supposedly “Tesla Certified Pre-Owned” Model 3, 2021, from the Glasgow branch on 13 March 2024. The person who delivered the car handed over the card keys, showed the extra mats and left. The car wasn’t cleaned properly too. That was awkward, but I also thought it was Tesla’s procedure. However, three days later, everything started to reveal.1) The camera calibration had been recently reset before the delivery. This was presumably done with the knowledge that there were issues with the vehicle, as immediately after the calibration, the safety and autopilot features became unavailable due to defective cameras.2)The left camera was becoming wholly black3)The rear camera was blurry, and there were numerous scratches on the lens.4) Even though the cameras, autopilot, and cruise control features were working occasionally, the car was making dangerous manoeuvres, thereby putting lives in danger.5) The condensation on headlights, rear lights and cameras was significant. (I was informed that the condensation coverage under warranty would not be applied unless it exceeded 50%. This conclusion was reached without physically examining the vehicle, based solely on the photographs provided via service request.)6) After being able to drive the car on the motorway, I realised there was deficient air and soundproofing from the windows. When I checked the windows closer the rubbers on two windows were not fitted.7) Last but not least, I discovered the ugliest truth when I became familiar with the car. There was a phone (also remotely via app), and two more card keys (probably previous owner) had full access to my car all along.None of the conditions were disclosed at the point of sale. I had to drive to Europe on 17 March 2024, which was a long before-planned business and leisure trip. Starting 16 March 2024, including phone calls and visiting the Tesla Centre, Glasgow, UK, the Tesla Centre, Edinburgh, UK and the Tesla Service Centre, Amsterdam, Netherlands, service request chat with Tesla Service Centre, Freiburg, Germany, and via e-mail to Tesla UK, Tesla US and Tesla NL. I couldn’t get any kind of response other than the service request I started. I was rejected to get a service from Tesla Service Centres in Amsterdam, Netherlands and Freiburg, Germany, even though the car was supposed to be under warranty. After days of conversation via service request, I was able to reach out to make a service appointment with the Glasgow Tesla Centre on 3 April 2024. I prepared a document telling of the issues, not being able to contact anyone and any department from Tesla Corporation except the service request. I explicitly requested to return the car and refund as these are significant safety issues. The branch supervisor in Glasgow Tesla Centre admittedly accepted that there was a huge issue and the car shouldn’t have been delivered like that in the first place. However, first, they told me that they could not apply the ‘14-day Return Policy’ (as I could have the chance to come from Europe and they were open during the Easter Holiday) and that the issue could be evaluated under the ‘30-day Rejection’. Then, they agreed to apply a ‘14-day Return Policy’ as this case was exceptional. However, they also wanted to make a deduction for mileage, which I explicitly refused as I have done everything in my power not to escalate this issue to this point. So, on 3 April 2024, I filled out the forms and left the car in the Glasgow Tesla centre. Today, 11 April 2024, I haven’t received any e-mails from Tesla Corporation. More importantly, I am still waiting for the refund. I am not able to buy another car and am still paying more for the rental cars. All in all, think at least ten times before buying a Tesla. You will not find anyone to contact to resolve an issue, and you will be expected to cover everything they caused.

I echo a recent review, whilst the car works it is great, Tesla's support however is atrocious!My husband and I both have the S Model and are of similar age.  Both cars have had the exact same issues within weeks of each other:Complete failure of heating systemDoors failing to open/opening whilst drivingSo both major issues - which cost upwards of £1500+ to fix each issue.  One car is annoying but acceptable, but both cars?!  They are not even slightly interested other than booking us in for repairs via the App and agreement to pay before the car is looked at.

Whilst the car works they are great.As soon as it doesn't don't expect any support from Tesla.

Over 3 years of ownership multiple issues and services centre visits. The car was lease new from Tesla direct the problems started from day one on build quality, the car has been in over 5+ times now for what should have been quality controls pickups. Boot electric lift has failed multiple times and other electrical components around the car. But it’s not just the cars that give issues a Wall Charger Gen3 has been problematic for months now not being reliable for scheduled charging. Ask Tesla support to look at it and after about 5 emails they stopped answering for over a month leaving us with no charging solution. I chased this multiple time and only got a reply after having to replace the charger with a reliable brand. As the charger is faulty (2 different Tesla models has same issue) asked for them to replace after new charger installed and Tesla one packed back in the box. Seems that a lot of the support staff don't understand that having to wait a long time is unacceptable. Having to now escalate as a formal complaint, but looking at review dont hold much hope that customer service will be given. Luckily the car is due to be replaced in 6 months, so I after all the poor build issues and support service I guess will not be another Tesla now as lost faith in the brand. Tesla needs to focus on good customer experiences or will see sales dive further in the future.

Great car, got the 3.Only issue is battery not the best, struggles in British winter a little

So many mistakes during lead up to delivery resulted in a terrible delivery experience.  Damage on car required two separate visits to Tesla service centre, where the customer services staff couldn't seem less interested.  I've wasted so much time talking to Tesla about the issues and submitting my complaint, with the only resolution eventually being a voucher to use on their website.  I expressed how the car was leased so I didn't want to spend more money on the car but they insisted that is all they would offer.  Trying to use the voucher but half the merchandise I'm vaguely interested in is out of stock and they have given me a deadline to use the voucher.Car software and Tesla website is so glitchy for a "tech" company.  Hated every minute of dealing with Tesla since spending a lot of money on a new car.  Expected much better service.

I bought three Tesla and own stock reserved a cybertruck in 2019 and they are giving them to their favorites !!!  It’s bull   Stop buying them

Continued fiasco of being unable to insure my facelift Model 3 and Tesla’s refusal to get its head from out of the sand!It is interesting but I shan’t be moving away from my insurance broker of 40 years outstanding service despite all the pressure from Tesla. In fact, after discussing the entire situation with my insurance broker again, it is clear few insurers (if any) want to insure the new Tesla Model 3 and something has changed in terms of old model to new.   Thank you Munro Greenhalgh for professionalism and ever reliable customer service that centres on protecting the CUSTOMER by good ‘old fashioned’ attention to detail, sadly unlike Tesla!I just may have found a clue to this fiasco: Autocar  7 March 2024Finally: new safety rules recognise that buttons beat touchscreensControls that have migrated away from physical buttons and onto touchscreens has left Matt Prior in despair.  To my relief, it looks like the answer to the question “is it just me?” is no.Too many cars in recent times have had me despairing at the number of controls that have migrated away from physical buttons and onto touchscreens. In some cases this is slightly annoying; in others I believe it’s borderline dangerous. Now the influential car safety rating organisation Euro NCAP has decided that, from 2026, it will award five-star ratings only to cars that retain physical controls for key features.Now that is pretty catastrophic for Tesla impacting not just the facelift Model 3 but the entire direction of the cars themselves. Watch out Tesla stock!My collection has been put off by Tesla until the 20th of March and I’m frustrated and downright annoyed that it’s taken all this to expose what may be the truth. Hubris Tesla Hubris!   Buying a new car should be a pleasurable experience not a nightmare!

Best car i have ever owned, worst service i have ever experienced. Let this service as a reminder to anyone considering buying a Tesla. The cars are great. The service is terrible. They try to weasel out of every warrenty claim possible and does not do recalls on things that are known to go bad due to poor design.I have gotten so many things changed on this car it's unbelievable but everytime i have to battle with the servicecenter to get it fixed. they force customers to accept a estimate and then say that don't worry you don't have to pay if it turns out it's a warranty claim. I hate to say but luckily my car is soon out of warranty so i don't have to waste anymore time on useless tesla employees

I am writing to file a formal complaint against Tesla, regarding a significant issue with my Tesla Model Y 2021, which I purchased inDecember last year. This matter pertains to false advertising and a failure to uphold the promised capabilities of the vehicle. DespiteTesla's advertising and product descriptions promising a range of 330 miles on a full charge, my car has consistently achieved at least40% less than this advertised range. This drastic shortfall has severely impacted the vehicle's usability and the value I derive from it. Ischeduled a service appointment with Tesla. The resolution proposed by the service team was both shocking and unacceptable. Theysuggested that to achieve the advertised range, I would need to disable the vehicle's cameras. This advice is not only impractical but alsonegates one of the key safety features of the car. There was no disclosure at the point of sale that the use of standard vehicle features,such as the cameras, would so drastically reduce the car's range. To suggest disabling a critical feature to achieve the advertisedperformance is misleading and diminishes the value and functionality of the vehicle. Feeling deceived by Tesla, as the product delivereddoes not meet the specifications and capabilities that were advertised, I am seeking a resolution to this matter. I propose the followingoptions: 1-A technical fix to the car that allows it to achieve the advertised 330-mile range without disabling any safety or standardfeatures. 2-Complimentary access to Tesla's Supercharger network 3-A full refund for the vehicle, allowing me to return the car.

I purchased a brand new car from Tesla which came with a navigation issue, car still locates itself in Tesla HQ in US even though I am in UK. I am given 1 month free premium connectivity due to purchase of the car and I couldn't use most of the features due to issue in my car. I asked to extend my free subscription at least up until resolution of the issue but my demand has been rejected by Tesla. I couldn't enjoy my car due to this problem for almost a month already and instead of being sorry, Tesla even doesn't about care their customers, so disappointing! Why then you sold a brand new car with a problem in it!

Very good, i met Elon Musk on the road an he said hi

I have had a few problems with my Tesla 3. The passenger seatbelt would not clip in. All service requests are done through app, and they seem to get back to book the car in. The technician was sent out to me, which 2 weeks I could not take my car in to be looked at at a service centre. Now my car won't lock, and again I can't get anyone to schedule a time to have it looked at. I am looking to sell the car less than a year after getting it due to bad customer service.

I am in the UK and I have Bought a Tesla Powerwall 2 and I have to say I have had nothing but problems. The software appears to have a bug that stops me changing any settings, no matter what I do they revert.Ive been waiting over a week for a response from their email address (which I had to dig for). I currently have a useless battery as the fixed settings mean it wont charge at cheap rate. This really is poor.

I have had my Tesla MX in for service 16 times in 2 years with a wide set of issues. They have made this process as difficult as possible. I finally had to sell it at a big loss to get out of this Groudhog day of car pain.

I think Elon Musk proved its point. He is even more than just a genious engineer! Because Tesla is far from just a company that makes cars, it literally disrupted the whole auto industry and shaping its future right now.I had the chance to drive around a few of their models, The Tesla Model 3 for example, and it was futuristic, it was simple, it was straightforward, it is so good! Apart from the tech, if we get to the actual car part, the acceleration is quite instant and smooth, you feel the power under your feet when you hit the gas pedal. Autopilot feature is also really something. the whole design of the car is quite sleek. I am not big fan of giant touchscreens, i am more of a button person but that's maybe because there are still so many cars available with buttons, but im sure it will be the game in town in a few years. They are on point. I know what youre thinking, charging infrastructure in so many countries are not on high levels. But they are getting there, no worries. It 's clean driving that will be in the forefront of everything in the future, so, be ready for the fundamental changes in this industry.Now what we see when we actualy look at a Tesla, it is just an ordinary electric vehicle on wheels. Could you have imagined such a thing fifty years ago? I don't know. God knows what sort of models and things will be on the roads in fifty years from now. Especially with Teslas. Exhilirating.

Warning - Tesla Legal Scam. Read this before you take Tesla to court. Tesla has two companies. One is called Tesla Motors, and the other is called Tesla Financial Services. If you purchase a car, it will come from Tesla Motors. When you have a problem with the vehicle, you will speak to the sales and customer support departments. If the dispute becomes legal, you will likely get transferred to the legal department, as I did. This is where the big scam begins.The legal department is a different company called Tesla Financial Services. They will engage with the complaint, and if you are still unhappy, they openly encourage you to take them to court. However, you are taking the wrong company to court! The judge threw out the case because I needed to take Tesla Motors to court instead of Tesla Financial Services!It's a very sneaky scam. Don't buy a Tesla. The car will go wrong, and then Tesla will do everything they can not to help you. Customer service is awful.

looking forward to getting model Y tesla .  put deposit down ( £200 )  told dealer i was away over christmas & would complete after 5th january meantime had electrician to house & to install charging point would entail changing both fuse boxes + siting in different place to ideal .no help from tesla re advice on charger nor on possible supplier(s)   why do they not link with / employ electricians for this ?  shouldn't be down to inexperienced me ?contacted re car & told i would have to collect fro different site to convenient dealer   why do they not deliver to this site for me to collect ?phoned twice ( no reply ) & emailed 3 times but no response to my further questions .pity as it is a lovely car but i cancelled in the light of unreasonable "post sales " service .probably unlikely to get any deposit back even though they will not speak/reply .

Alles is goed en cool maar het is een schande dat de auto geen Apple Carplay heeft…

No Service, no Phone possible, ist horrible. Never again.

I've had my Model 3 for 6 years and it's still a fantastic car. It's needed almost no maintenance the entire time other than new tires. I have saved so much money compared to the Prius I had before and this is a more pleasurable car to drive and a lot safer.

I Washingtonpost.com kan man läsa: Several weeks into the strike, he said his manager called and accused him of leaking company secrets. The issue: Kuzma’s wife had criticized Tesla on X. “The craziest part is they were monitoring, they were checking my wife’s profile,” he saidHelt sjukt att en arbetsgivare gör så mot sina anställda.

One year after I purchased my Y I found out Trsla haven’t or couldn’t upload my WOF at this time. So I can’t get a new Rego. I called Tesla and they only make excuses why they never informed me and told me that they can’t find the documents anymore. So I have to get in to get a quick check up, but instead to make it at the closes Tesla service I have to drive over 1 hour. They can’t even say sorry just excuses it’s not their fault it was system problem. I didn’t expect such a bad service.

Fantastic service & incredible vehicles! Model 3 10/10

I have had a model 3LR for over three years on contract hire. I extended the contract for a year. The cover underneath the car for the Heat Exchange(?) is hanging loose and making a scraping noise. I am told that thisis made from a fabrice material(!). New cars have a plastic cover. This happens when driving through large puddles at speed (!). Cost not covered by warranty to repair £200.00! Really shoddy material! The service has been quite good, however. I am told that I can drive in the meantime and it will not do any damage and the repair is in a week. I am having second thoughts about replacing this car with another Tesla.

I own the Tesla S plaid. The concept of positionig the turn indicator, beam, wiper and horn button into the yoke stearing wheel is a desaster!!! When turning the yoke 180° it is nearly impossible to hit the right button!! Fatal accidents due to this will occur,  as it is very likely, that you will hit the wrong button.Quality is very poor as well. Noises at the drivers window above 60 mph and not realy overall good production quality,  Service is a nightmare as well. I'm now waiting for 3 weeks to get my car fixed.  It was totaly dead, I even could not access the car, it had to be towed.  Definitefly the first and the last Tesla I owned.

All the cars of Tesla are apparently quite good. The performance and look are perfect combination of something we all demand in our cars.However, the current price of cybertruck has been increased by 50% (approx) compared to the prebooking price which was really unexpected

I ordered a car back in July. Today is November 20th, I'm still without a car. In your personal account, the date changes every 4 days. The day before yesterday it was November 16th. This morning is November 20th. On the evening of November 24th.

Superior cars that don't ruin the environment. Great service. Driving a Tesla is a great experience in itself. Great company that does well for the world in general.

I WOKE UP IN MY NEW BUGATTI AND IT WAS DISCUSTYIN G

I regret deeply that I bought a Tesla! I could not have imagined that I would feel such regret in my life. I wonder if Tesla has by any chance found the most uncongenial peoples for the costumer service?

This is not about Tesla cars but customer service.The customer experience at Northampton was very disappointing, I went with 2 other colleagues and the sales people were unprepared, very disorganised with a bit of attitude -"we are getting paid either way", after registered 3 times, still unable to find details of registration, very useless and disorganised, very disappointing, expect more from Tesla than this, very disgraceful.

Tesla service Tampa, I left car 15 days & did not move!!Then st Pete’s fl They worked on after 11 days and returned it to me unassembled for $860.00 all the molding was left off and trunk wouldn’t close!!  When I came back they left the battery cable loose !! I was going to stop payment but they agree to put the car back together…I have back up paper work.   Love the car but will not buy another one due to service & customer service..

Always had a good experience, got a Model Y 2023 SR in Canada. Customer service in Quebec City was 10/10 very helpful same for the service which we had to call only once. The service showed up to my workplace to fix the glove box.

Very bad attitude and no desire to help.I had my car cloned this was an awful experience and not helped by speaking to Tesla they said they can’t help. I contacted the Police they said the cloned car would be marked but I should get new plates, I purchased new plated and had to register with DVLAGuess who cloned the original plates yes TESLA not even an apology offered £30 the cost was £250 By rights they should be prosecuted I even had a car park ticket for £100 this was the Tesla cloned car.Do not get involved with this company

I really like my Tesla  it’s a marvel of modern automotive engineering, blending sleek design with cutting-edge technology. I am eagerly awaiting the implementation of the self-driving capability, which I believe will redefine our approach to commuting and traveling.Owning a Tesla has been a delightful experience, combining style, performance, and technology in one package. The anticipation for the self-driving capability is high, and I believe it will revolutionize our driving experiences, making them safer and more enjoyable. Tesla’s commitment to innovation, sustainability, and customer satisfaction makes it a leader in the automotive industry, and I am proud to be a part of this electric revolution.

My passenger seatbelt has jammed up. I logged the request for service on the app, and they finally got back to me after 2 days, after messaged again to ask how long a response takes. They send me an estimate of £0 to repair it, but no button to click to accept the estimate. They emailed me the estimate, but still no way of agreeing to the repair. I emailed them to agree, and the email bounced back. My car is unusable if I need to take an adult passenger or 4 passengers. I will never buy a Tesla again.

I have a 17 month old Tesla 3 LR and I have reported the same fault FOUR times. The speedometer, gear selector, lights on the touch screen disappear when the car is being driven. Then the touch screen goes black and then goes into a hard reset. After two software downloads, then 2 weeks in a Tesla service centre and now the car is going back yet again to the service centre. I regret the day I bought it!

I just had a frustrating call with the customer service team, especially Joel M. If you're reading this, Joel, this message is for you!I was expecting to receive my Model 3 Performance this week in September. However, Tesla canceled my order and gave me the option to choose the new Model 3 or cancel altogether. Seriously? I've already waited for months, and now I can't even get the performance model, only the long-range version and then wait another 5 months till I would get that one.But that's not the end of it. There was a Model 3 Performance available in Queensland that I wanted to purchase, but apparently, I couldn't because I live in Sydney. Can someone explain the logic behind this? I thought when a car is available, a customer should be able to buy it, and the company would make an extra effort to fix a situation that has caused the customer so much trouble. It was frustrating that I couldn't pick up the car with an NSW license or an unregistered vehicle license. These solutions should be possible if Tesla cares about customer satisfaction, but all I encountered was arrogance.To add to the frustration, I also didn't receive my $400 order fee refund. Believe me, if Tesla wasn't currently the best electric vehicle option, I'd be the first to switch. No empire lasts forever, and when that time comes, I won't hesitate to recommend to everyone I know to NOT buy a Tesla. Thanks for nothing Joel, Senior Virtual D********

Very bad and poor customer service! When place an order, never reply to email and phone call! Can’t even get in touch with any tesla advisor! Never recommend to anyone at all!

Summary after three years of Model S Performance ownership. Car is good, software temperamental but tolerable, gimmicks are fun. I will not return to have another Tesla for the foreseeable future due to the dire customer service. I am filled with dread when a warning appears, the virtual assistant is definitely a human rather than a bot as they are unreliable and dishonest. I feel fobbed off. Telephone interaction better but almost impossible to get in touch in the first place. They also do not wash the car when they repair or service it. Not what I expect from the luxury (£100k+) end of the market. BMW next for me, I feel like a valued customer with them

They make it so difficult to buy a new car. The website just doesn't work and is full of bugs. The information is wrong and the offers are not real. The after sales service is extremely poor and they just stop answering emails.

I can’t stress enough how disappointing my service experience has been with Tesla on multiple occasions now. First, it was the charging issue. I spent around two months going back and forth, trying to convince Tesla that there was a problem with my car’s charging compatibility. During this period, my third-party service provider not only replaced my charger three times but also offered me discounts on my charges, which is far more than Tesla ever did.And now, I find myself in another long-winded ordeal. I’ve waited 35 days for an appointment to fix a non-opening passenger door, only to be told that the necessary parts are unavailable. It’s mind-boggling how a company that prides itself on being cutting-edge can be so archaic when it comes to customer service. I’m not dealing with a minor inconvenience here; I can’t even open my passenger door!I’m starting to question Tesla’s credibility and commitment to customer satisfaction. These aren’t isolated incidents but a recurring pattern of poor service and lack of accountability. It’s completely unacceptable

Can’t fault service and support. Everytime I have had an engineer to my chosen location, taking it to a local service centre has been a breeze. Always helpful. Unsure on some of the comments around poor service. Can’t fault for the midlands support.

We’ve had two so far and nothing but praise for this carmaker. Elon keep it up.

I own Tesla Model Y and since Saturday (19/08/2023) there is fail in Window which can not be locked and car can not be locked. I reached Tesla customer service and they said there is no support on weekend and a mobile service technician will visit your home on Monday. Today, I got call that its only possible to visit my home to see it on Wednesday (23/08/2023) :-(I made many calls to Aarhus Denmark service center but no help at all :-(Now I am stuck for not being able to use my Tesla Model Y for last 3-4 days and get stuck in myhome :-(Never had such a bad experience in owning my 5 cars before from various brands and really puzzled about Tesla's service. Kind Regards,Amit

Tesla’s support service is THE worst. They will not answer your questions and close service request randomly. They make it incredibly hard to talk to a human and thier text support is slow and nearly useless

Sent me a baby's T-Shirt instead of Memory stick for which  I paid £40.I spent half an hour on phone to talk to someone who cannot help me and asked me to go online and ask for a refund pack and label which I did  and also wrote several emails. I still have not received my memory stick or label to return the wrong product!

I would give no stars but you cant leave that. Vehicle had a steering lock fault . Was told it was a sensor issue and would need to get to service centre for repair. When I advised I lived 110 miles away from nearest service centre I refused to drive as it was dangerous they refused to send and engineer but said the would try a software update. Now they knew it was a sensor issue but clearly didn’t want to have the cost of an engineer so tried to cut corners. So today it happens again on an busy island . Really scary and wouldn’t unlock . Now been recovered to Repair centre. Dispite me being female and on my own, Tesla were quite happy for me to make my own arrangements to get home . Not their issue . Clearly is their issue as they should have done the correct fix in the first place rather thank cut corners. This could have been much worse outcome today

No money left?They try to slip away from the promised refund.Are they in that bad economy maybe?

Within one week of buying S Tesla, driver-side door glass sealing rubber started coming out, allowing rainwater to seep inside the door. The right side mirror stopped folding. Extremely disappointed about the quality of the car.

Poor customer service from UK, Home charger plate shattered after just 3 months. Customer service took weeks to come back to me to say that because they cannot know for sure it was a warranty claim and i have to pay for a replacement. So basically called me a liar that the plate just shattered and wasn't damaged

Elon is such a bright mind! Tesla motors the biggest and best car company in the world... Disrupting an century of dominance from other manufactures

Very happy indeed, I have to say im blown away with my Model 3, ok couple of very minor issues when it arrived but it was dealt with quickly by Tesla Centre London Park Royal. I find the range well adequate for London motoring

I'm happy with the car and the deal I got from the company. me get exactly what I was looking for.

Car is great: but:delivered with a few teething problems and this is where the BIG elephant in the room is. EVERYTHING is done online and it is IMPOSSIBLE to contact anyone even a 'known' agent.so EVERYTHING gets delayed/lost in the non human contact over countless email- most go unreplied.Great shame, car is great, service is appaling.

One star is overrated for this company. The car is great but the customer service is appalling. Delay to get the car which resulted in the trade in value going down. When asked about compensation they could not do anything apart from some vouchers to purchase their products online. When I tried to contact them again to maybe look at the option of getting a new car, no one bothered to call back. I finally decided not to spend more money on them and to get another brand.DM the Tesla account on twitter, again no response. Never been treated in this way by any company!

Ordering online and collection experience was very quick and smooth, and the Tesla staff were friendly. Making payment was challenging as had to make sure it wasn't fraud, my bank were not able to check against details provided and I had to pay extra bank charge for the amount due as Tesla ask for bank transfer. Trade-in was very poor, was given an estimate but then after paying order fee was told the final quote on trade-in was £1k less. Decided against trading in but it was too late to back-out of buying the Tesla car.

Two stars is being very, very generous. In the 3,000 miles I have owned this car I have had to raise two charging issues. The first was a faulty connection cable that required a replacement due to me being unable to charge using it. Then it started to fail on Supercharging which was eventually diagnosed to be an issue with the DC connectivity. This meant I had to rearrange weekend plans at my expense (don't even ask about a courtesy car!) and to add insult to injury the "free" Supercharging miles cannot be extended due to the fault with the vehicle.I'm only giving two stars as the team members are polite and obviously embarrassed about the situation.DO NOT buy a Tesla unless you are ready to go all-in, it's a bigger commitment than a dog - trust me!

If there is one thing that is true about Tesla customer service it is consistently POOR!!!  If you want to get hold of them on the phone wait times are 40,50, even 60+ minutes long sometimes. The customer service reps tell you to go to the app but don’t know how to direct you there! What an awful, pitiful state for a car that we pay substantial premium for!

I booked tesla in Nov 2022 and I am still waiting.. I referred a friend and he booked in April 2023 and he is getting it on 30 June... Dont know what Tesla is upto. Also Plenti (tesla preferred finance provider) bumped the interest rate as the car is not delivered on time. Why should a customer suffer due to the delay caused by Tesla. I regret getting a Tesla and I would not refer anyone in future.

Not only is their product beyond useless and fails regularly but their Customer Service levels are deplorable! Call backs never materialise, Supervisors “don’t take calls” and there is no clear complaints process available.48 hours After their useless Model 3 broke down, I’m still here without any mobility…..they took my car to a service centre 45 miles away because the nearer one (still 23miles away) was “busy”……they then expect me to undertake a journey at my cost to go and collect a loan car (despite initial suggestions that a rental would be delivered to me). After 42 hours of frustration, they offer me an Uber voucher that covered approximately 75% of the cost……this Uber voucher appears not to work to which Tesla inform is “Ubers problem now”………..if this were any other OEM they would have had a courtesy vehicle delivered me to within hours of their product failing. It is evident that Customer retention is not high on their agenda.

Complete joke. Ordered a Model Y LR mid May apparently for immediate delivery. 15 days ago I received a message saying my car is nearly here so I thought great i'll sell my old car. The car is still not here, no confirmed delivery date. Very, very poor service which I hadn't bothered.

Bought some roof bars with a faulty cover on one of the corners.Emailed Tesla boutique EMEA for a replacement, but they don't reply.Cowboys.

One for all , all for one ☘️Absolutely gorgeous in every single point they create..Number 1.Love Aylin to Elon

From ordering a car to taking delivery from Tesla in the UK is a complete nightmare from start to finish.They aren't a conventional dealership like any you would recognise, think Amazon for cars. You don't get to deal with a human but an Algorithm. You can't speak to your local branch as they don't have a phone number and everything is routed through their Call Centre in Maidenhead. You can request to get a call from your local centre but I tried 8 times and never did anyone call back.After you pay your deposit you have 48 hours to complete the deal and pay the money.Tesla give you the Bank details of where to pay the money (in our case over £42K) The bank flashes up that this could be a fraudulent account and is not recognised proceed in the understanding you could lose your money. It is because Citi Bank isn't recognised in the UK.Trying to get basic info was horrendous. I spoke to the salesperson in the showroom and asked what the BHP of the car was, they said "what's BHP"We tried to get the registration number for the car to sort out insurance but we were told the car will be registered only on the day of collection so entering the Reg No into websites doesn't work.Tesla seem to have a thing going with Directline insurance. You can't collect your car without insurance but they won't register the car with DVLA unless you provide Insurance. Catch 22. Directline insurance was £700 more expensive than my current insurer.

Owned more than 20 cars in my lifetime. Now, I am the proud owner of the Tesla Model S, and I must admit that this electric marvel deserves every praise. The Model S redefines what it means to drive. A masterpiece!

Car ok but communication with Tesla finance all but impossible. Very disappointing.

Purchased a used inventory Tesla Model 3 in March 23 via the website. It was almost impossible to order due to IT errors, then spent 3 hrs at the showroom trying to order it, eventually I got the order placed. The showroom said I had to pick the car up within 2 weeks so sold my current car, a couple of weeks passed an I was then given a pickup date and told to transfer the money within 72hrs which I did. As soon as the transfer was done the pickup was cancelled, I called the customer services many times it was a complete mess and they couldn't tell me when the car would be ready, many hours on the phone and weeks later I picked it up. The good news was that the car was in excellent condition and exceeded my expectations but the process of purchasing was a complete mess.

MY CAR EXLOED, THANKS EXLON!!!!I SEPDN LIKE 2 BTC ON TESTAL AND IT EXPLODED IM DEPRESSED NOW WHAT WILL U DO ?!

1 star is being generous. The car is 6 months old, the infotainment system hasn’t worked for 5 of those 6 months. Raised the issue and they have been saying that the software team is working on it and the problem will be resolved in of the future OTA updates. No can tell me anything about when that update will come through. Could be in a week, a month or a year. The car is great and the supercharger network is awesome. Everything else is quite the opposite.

Model 3 Long Range strange vibration through steering on day of collection.  Reported via Tesla app. 5 dealer visits in 5 weeks, one new set of tyres, 3 wheel rebalances and no better.  Steering shudders at 28-32mph, 37-39, 44-47, 51-54, 65-69mph. Even though 2 separate technicians agreed there was vibration and it was not normal, Tesla have given up because they can't find anything wrong and are fobbing me off with "it's a known characteristic". As car is on personal lease with Tesla Financial Services, they have to reject the car,  not me.  But clearly they are in bed with Tesla so have said it's not grounds for rejection, so tough s£!t Mr customer. Now with Financial Ombudsman,  let's see what happens next. Such a pity.  Car is good just Tesla customer service is pathetic and they really don't seem to care. When there is more competition and choice in the market, people will choose based on things that RETAIN customers in the long term.  CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Tesla will be demoted to the history books.

The car is great to drive in itself as well as the convenience of the fast charge points; however you take that element away and you have the below issues:- Parts/tyres supply is very poor and you are talking about a month off the road if you have a flat tyre...- Customer service: you can't reach an actual person very easily. I spent 25 mins on the phone to their automated line waiting to be passed through to someone at a non-peak time. When you get through to someone they seem under trained and have limited English skills to understand the true problem you have.- Tesla superchargers are great. But there isn't enough of them. This is a common problem for electrics so it would be unfair to just pinpoint tesla though. - it looks like they have sped through the production of the cars as my paintwork has begun to peel away- the alloy/wheel format is ridiculously open to getting scratches on the alloys if you get remotely close to a curb- the range is not a true reflection of what the car actually does. The car does a lot less miles even when driving economically, than what it advises.

Elon Musk has turned Twitter into a fake news Mecca for GOP customers.Using fake news woke as campaign to induce hatred along with fear to make people support Billionaires agendas. Tesla quality is old technology and I had reservations for truck and a Y. Tesla changed their deposit rules lost $250 on car that came 2-3 years late. Elon has ruined his image with Twitter. Elon has ruined his reputation with abandonment of Tesla while pursuing his fake news GOP agenda. I have sold most of my Tesla holdings moved to other EV Companies doubling my money in a short period of time. As a Tesla share holder I demand the Tesla Board removes Elon as CEO so Elon can pursue his woke GOP fake news platform Twitter. I have closed my Twitter account today. I have a 2023 Mach e on order and a 2024 Cadillac Lyriq on order. Elon today has taken away 1st amendment rights to free speach saying if Elon thinks you are lying,  Elon will close your Twitter account. Elon I closed mine the second I took your woke GOP survey.

nice comapny! Very innovative and delivers slightly behind the schedule!

Car was way over priced and had a ton of issues off the line that I had to spend time driving an hour to the nearest service center. Realistic Range is at minimum 10% less than advertised. The seat design is ass if you don’t sit with your head slouched. The rims stick out further than the robber so if you barely touch a curb your rims get destroyed. Customer service is responsive but not good. Very disappointed because I love the company but I would not recommend buying a Tesla and I will never again because of this experience. I have had the car for 6 months and I’m will to take a $30,000 loss to get rid of the POS

Very Good company!Excellent product and excellent customer care!!!

I noticed there are 2 Tesla's on here, so copied my experience here to make sure it's seen.Ordered from Used Inventory in March expecting to collect in Edinburgh as stated on the Website. Given a Delivery Date of end of March.... in Birmingham. Oh well, I can still get to Birmingham. Paid in full, sold existing vehicle. Delivery Date cancelled via SMS, no explanation, spent the next few weeks being told a pack of lies from various agents, none of whom can provide an ETA. I'm now completely car-less and have no idea when I will get my car.If you are sold on the Tesla dream, please please please re-think. Look at all these reviews! I wish I had seen them before ordering, this is not review bombing, these are genuine customer experiences. The cars may be great (I wouldn't know), but there are other EV's out there (Polestar, Audi, BMW, VW) that are 80-90% as good as a Tesla, but the manufacturer will treat you 1,000,000% better as a customer. All Tesla care about is hitting quarterly new vehicle numbers to keep share holders happy.This company should not be allowed to do business in the UK with such shocking business practices, they should be investigated and fined by every regulatory body under the sun.Please please please think about what you value most when owning a vehicle.UPDATE: 26th April - 6 weeks since ordering from Used Inventory, still no collection date in sight. Every week is "hopefully next week". Tesla have my money and are holding me to ransom. Dreadful company.UPDATE: 12th May - Finally have the car after 8 weeks. Warnings on the screen and dodgy respray on the front wing. What have they been doing with this car for 8 weeks?

My Tesla Powerwall failed and I was told they would replace it. When I called it holds you for a while then auto hangs-up. Emails - no response.

Third class customer service Takes about 1 hour 30 minutes to talk to someone . Got brand new car last week, had a scratch on  bumper- they said someone will contact to repair - about 12 days - no one contacted yet. Spend over 50 k and they don’t even give full charge battery , had a to get delivery about 2 hours drive away -no home delivery or nearby Tesla showroom delivery which might be easy for customers. As Tesla is saving their transport cost, very stressful experience as very first time purchased electric car, people over the phone also not very helpful- looks like they are just reading standard reply from piece of paper or on the computer. Very very disappointing 😠

I have a M3LR bought new a year ago. In that time it has completely failed twice. First time a charge fault could not be remotely diagnosed and it was taken away and took over 2 weeks to repair. This month I was overseas and the car was pushed a software update which failed and completely bricked the car. It is towed away and is still being 'serviced'. I put that in quotes because I am unable to get any meaningful information from Tesla about progress. Customer Service is non-existent. Impossible to call service centres directly you have to use a Tesla call centre. They are superficially helpful but ultimately hopeless. I will never buy another Tesla. Once they have your money, you are a hostage. Nothing more.

On January 24th, the PSI of my passenger front side tire went down to 37. I brought the car in the evening around 5:30 pm and they told me that it would take 1.5-2 hours. They said that I needed two new tires.  So they gave me a loaner. I went to Metro and picked up a meal and came back around 8 pm as the app said it would be ready at that time. When I came back, the doors were locked so I sat outside and ate my meal in the car. After an hour, I sent a message (around 9:30 pm). No reply.I got my car at 10:30 pm!The next day was a snow storm so I did not go to work.January 27thThe day after, the PSI dropped again on the same side on the NEW tire! They asked me to bring it the next morning and I did and then they said I needed a new rim! They asked if I had gone over a pothole and I said no. This was 36 hours after a new tire! They said that it must have been missed when they replaced the new tires and that they had to order a new rim which again was like another $1800! So they put on a replacement and away I went.February 9thI got my new rim.Since I got it, I kept getting messages saying that the Adaptive Ride was disabled, so I made an appointment.February 13thI took the car in at 4:45 and they gave me a loaner as they said it would take 1.5-2 hours.  I went home and sent a message around 5:30 pm asking them to please check the front passenger seatbelt as I think it was twisted. I got no response. At 8:45 pm, I asked for an update and got no response.I only got a message the next morning after 10 am while I was at work that it was ready for pick up. It asked me what time I would pick up the car and it did not even give me the time to respond as the service item was marked closed.When I picked up the car after work, I had no update as to what was done, was my seatbelt issue addressed or anything. I had to ask all these questions!When the "service manager" called me 3 times between January 27th and February 9th, why was he SO rude? Why did he behave like he was calling from credit collections? The bill was already paid! But I was not treated with respect.Why is the service better at Toyota and Lexus?  I do not feel like I am treated with respect or valued at Tesla.  THIS is what is feels to own a Tesla?!  I was treated with class, respect and given amazing customer service at Lexus and Toyota.  I feel I have downgraded instead of upgraded. April 5thAnother tire gone!They just sent an invoice with no details and just want it paid!Tesla does not stand by its core values...one being respect. That is where it starts from.

needed to bring my car in for updating system collected the car back noticed straight away . car has scrate on side went direct in side there showroom  I asked to look @ it they they closing now.... so need to come tomorrow next I had COVID week later.... I did message email  same day that my car was scared.... week v later no answer still. today I wanted to charge my Tesla they have even taken out the chargers cables so angry

I bought a wall connector and pedestal as I didn't know which one I needed. Tesla charged me for both. Only the connector arrived. I simply want a refund for the pedestal as 1. it didn't arrive and 2. I don't need it now as the electrician has said that the connector on its own is fine. I have emailed and emailed and NO ONE replies. So what can I do now? The online sales department is completely separate from the car department so they cannot help me. (At least they do answer my emails).

The worst customer service ever. Sales Officers are gross (Flavia L. being the worst ever interlocutor) and do not provide any support.Very happy with the car, but the way it was delivered was a terrible experience.

This comment is on my buying experience.  Things started heading south when the expected delivery dates started to change.  Initially the reset was +6-8 weeks later than initially confirmed on the website at time of order.  Then every week the expected dates changed.  Some pulled in a week or two, then some pushed out 2-6 weeks.  More recently, the dates have changed every other day.  Two days ago, the expected pickup date was 1-3 weeks out.  Then a day later, I get notified to schedule pickup "now".  No times compatible with my work schedule were offered, so I did not choose one.  I called the office and waited on hold, and waited and waited.  One day later they threaten to release my car to someone else and only offer me times at night when it is impossible to inspect the vehicle properly.  I confirm an appointment anyway and now they tell me the pickup location has been changed to a different city and county.  Why is this experience so unprofessional?  Is this typical of Tesla?  I realize they are selling everything as fast as they can build them, but customer service seems to be a problem.

Ownership of my Tesla over the last year has been completely fine. The car hasn't let me down and been great to drive. Ordering was straight forward as was collection. One minor issue was resolved through the service function via the app and was repaired at my workplace. If you're thinking of ordering, use this referral code for some free supercharger miles. Well worth it.. jamie859126

Still on hold (2h+) as car didn’t arrive. How on earth can a company be run like this.Edit: Car arrived 7 hours late. Got a call about 6 hours late to say it’s on the way. Review upgraded from 1* to 2* now but low because of non-existent customer service

Let down on delivery.  Sat in all day to have some excuse as to why the car cant be delivered.  Told I have to wait in all day tomorrow now, which is just not good enough.  Honestly, noone else in my company will order a Tesla as this is the second one, and both have had delivery issues.  The worst thing is that noone cares one little bit.

I would never buy a Tesla again.  I love my car but the service team in fort worth texas is horrible.  I made an appointment for service because the navigation system is stuck, I have no safety features and a fan keeps coming on draining the power on the battery.  They checked me in, had a service technician sit in the car.  They told me they saw everything that I did in the car not working.  I heard nothing from them all day and asked for an update on the car.  Still silence.  I checked the app the next day and it said they had cancelled my appointment.  No one contacted me and told me it was cancelled.  Next appointment is two weeks out.  I am fed up and would not suggest anyone buying a Tesla.  There are a lotof newer options out there for EV.  Buy something else instead.

Great buy the cars. But when it comes to home charging Tesla don't support you. Home chargers are sold online and you will have to get your own installers. Their so-called recommended installers don't even reply to emails asking for quotes. After sales support is very important Tesla.

Had the car for three and a half years from new, servicing/repairs are always the frustrating issue. You have to book through the app, where it's triaged and with messages back and forth this can add a week before you can even book a time slot. The usual wait for us is about a week after that.The actual service engineers are really pleasant and competent, but there's this triage layer that sits between that communicates only via "messages in the app", faceless and often heartless "thankyou for your understanding" is the de facto signature when they push your appointment out or cancel something.Our most recent issue is the car stopped kicking out any heat from the HVAC, in winter in England. We've just been delayed another week, as the parts have no ETA and they are just pushing us back week at a time. It's been 4 weeks currently.The car doesn't heat at all, and if the HVAC is turned on it pump out ice cold air. It won't defog, it wont clear windscreen and my 6 year old kid has endured three weeks of being driven to school in around 0 degree temperatures. It's borderline dangerous as it does fog up quickly and you can't clear it when driving. This doesn't seem to concern tesla, or do anything to change your place in the parts bin queue.There's a side issue where some of the water proof lining under the car has come off, and even though it's no fault of ours, that's not a warranty issue and they are happy to bill us £180 for what could easily be classed as poor trim fittings, or should be done complementary to apologize for having to endure a winter in England with no heating or defogging in the car.I can't use the car for work as I work 2 hours drive away and I would either have to drive with the windows partially down and in a coat and gloves. We are a one car family, so having to wait 4-6 weeks for parts is kind of crippling.I have the performance model and love the car to bits. It's just such a shame their customer service is so utterly and unashamedly awful, and what's worse is there's no visible plan to correct this. We've seen this over 3.5 years, and it's definitely got worse that over this time, despite what they might counter.Was thinking of going Tesla Solar, and Power Walls for home but this is the final straw. If we ever had an issue with that, the customer service would be of the same model so to heck with that.Concerningly in the UK the current thing is to try and adopt a tesla style hands off approach to customer service, but that would be great if it worked. It doesn't, so strap yourself in for a bumpy ride.Car is good (Model 3 performance), has it's faults and is by no means perfect, but is seriously undone by customer service designed by millennials. Never used to think I'd go back, but not so sure anymore. Waiting a month for a repair/parts for your car kinda puts things in perspective

If I could give this zero stars I would Worst customer service ever compared to other car manufacturers. ELON - it’s simple go and get the best customer experience manager from a competitor and pay them well in order to get your customers the right customer experience.. because your failing big time !!! POOR POOR !

Terrible customer service.Tesla took my initial fee and even though the engineers had said they could not install solar panels on our roof, no one at Tesla bothered letting me know. They waisted 3 weeks of my time. I couldn’t find any information on the website and I finally had to contact the initial sales person to find out the status.Interestingly our house is only 10 years old and I got 4 quotes from other solar companies, for free, in a matter of a few days and none of them had any issues with the roof!I’m so glad we found out why Tesla’s customer service scores are so low before doing any business with them. I’ll be paying a couple of thousand dollars more with the company we chose, but it will be well worth it.

I recently bought the Tesla and I am absolutely thrilled with it! It is a fantastic vehicle that drives well, is reliable, and has all the extras you'd expect. The features are easy to use and make driving enjoyable. The performance of this car is amazing--it accelerates quickly yet still maintains excellent fuel economy. Overall, I am highly impressed with this car and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great electric vehicle.

Non existent customer service. The cars are great as long as you don't have a problem and have to deal with "customer service" absolutely shocking

I recently purchased a Tesla, and I have been disappointed in the overall experience. The car is great in terms of performance, but there are too many issues that are causing me great frustration. The navigation system is overly complicated to use, and even experienced drivers struggle to understand how it works. Additionally, the customer service provided by Tesla has been unreliable; they frequently don't answer when contacted. In short, while the Tesla may offer some unique features, it is not worth the hassle or expense.

We have owned our model 3 for just over two years and have experienced nothing less than excellent service from every department with whom we have had contact. The car had a couple of minor issues/recalls and on each occasion we were supplied with an equivalent model for the duration with complementary charging, I can’t see any other manufacturers offering free fuel!Superchargers work extremely well, unlike many other charge networks. This car has proved exceptional value over the 30,000 miles we have done so far, saving around £4k in diesel costs compared to our previous car. We have only recently needed to replace the rear tyres, anyone saying they’re heavy on tyres needs to learn to drive efficiently. We have never experienced range anxiety unlike drivers of other EV’s report and the 8 or so minutes to top up your charge is no hardship.

This is the worst company I have ever dealt with!

Like so many others the service experience of Tesla here in New Zealand/Aotearoa is just shocking.No response to email, truly shocking online site with no tracking, no phone numbers.  The car is a pleasure (so far, touch wood) but the inability to respect customers does not bode well for this company.

I’d like to say that so far I’m really not happy with the service, promises made or what you guys have sold us into.We’ve not received any refunds on delivery charges as promised from us having to collect the vehicle our selves, I’ve been phoning the number given to me to exercise my rights to cancel this agreement from the very start of the month and not getting anything back from you guys.I made it clear when I took my family in December that we were only doing a test drive and if anything make an order for the Model Y Long Range closer to my wife’s birthday and that I’m hoping that the prices will drop by then, instead you guys convinced me that this was the best offer you’ve seen, the RWD standard range would be plenty adequate, the prices will only go up… so I asked if I could order at the time and take delivery of the vehicle closer to the time of my wife’s birthday and you guys said no because we wouldn’t benefited from all the offers because we had to take delivery of the vehicle before the end of Dec.I find this funny how the decrease in price took place on Friday 13th of Jan which is exactly just enough time to take people out of their 14 days cooling off period. I now understand that the agent who dealt with us is on paternity leave which I’m very happy for him but I’m tired of being ignored after what you guys have done to us.On top of all this the interest rates you guys charge have dropped to 3.9%, so nothing you guys have told us have actually been better for us, you guys have talked me out of my plan and now we’re the only ones paying for it and none of you have spoken to us about any of this, I just keep ending up speaking to random people over the phone.

You have just undermined all credibility with the recent price reduction - how can I ever trust to buy a Tesla again when the price is not stable? I bought my Y one month ago. How will you compensate the huge loss, I have just endured?

Wish Tesla should do some heating where the door handles are. In the window they seem to be stuck. Very hard to open

I ordered a Tesla Model Y Performance in March 2022, anticipating delivery by the end of the year. The car arrived a month early, in November 2022. And my excitement at embracing an EV was soon thwarted! I received a call from Tesla the night before delivery, asking me to confirm a few personal details to ensure their records were correct. Following the call, by my surprise I received an e-mail from ALD Finance (Tesla’s incumbent finance company) requesting me to sign a new finance agreement, despite having signed one two months prior! On the day of collection (24 November), I spent over an hour on the phone with a Tesla‘s finance team who stated numerous times that Tesla had made a mistake and that I should ignore the e-mail. I re-confirmed this with Tesla’s onsite finance team, they checked their records and confirmed everything was in order and that they had the signed finance agreement. On this basis they handed me the key/ card to the car. An elderly couple waiting with us to collect their car, were less fortunate. They had travelled several hundred kilometres to collect the car from Brent Cross Delivery Hub and despite being promised a walkthrough on how to operate the electric car, the Tesla employee simply said (quote): we don’t have any staff that can help you, from the very top of the organisation”. They were given the ultimatum of either collecting the car or rescheduling collection so they could bring someone with them who can operate the EV. I didn’t hang around to see how this played out as we had already waited an hour to collect our car and were in a rush to get back and collect our kids from school! Back to my Tesla fiasco. A few weeks after collecting the car, I received a call from Tesla’s finance team informing me that they had assigned the wrong car – yes, the wrong car – to my finance agreement and that I was indeed required to re-sign the new agreement, which meant an additional £200 a month! I offered to buy the car outright to which they agreed, subject to a re-quote as the car would be deemed as a used car (having been owned by Tesla in the few weeks that I had been driving it). A week later, now 23rd December, I received a call from Tesla informing me that in fact, I would NOT be allowed to buy the car as it had already been assigned to ALD. And it was not that the wrong car was assigned but in fact, it was a quote that I signed, not the Finance Agreement itself. Oh, and the onsite Tesla team released the car in error!The representative was obviously very confused and apologised at least 10 times, admitting Tesla takes full responsibility for the error (oh, the empathy!!) but then followed up with a ransom: either I re-sign the finance agreement with the new terms, or they would need the car to be returned on Christmas Eve as Tesla's entire finance team (I think that's 5 people in total) was to be shut down between Christmas and New Year. And so the marking of the end of my first and last, brief relationship with Tesla. Having purchased numerous cars in my time, Tesla is the bottom of the barrel when it comes to the quality of customer service, from their sales team to after-sales support and finance. Just give Tesla a call and you will see that their wait times are often 1-2 hours, literally any time of the day!How they justify their high price tag for what are very ordinary cars, amazes me! They have enjoyed thriving in a nascent market but the competition is catching up and Tesla will be back in the red…and all because Musk is adamant on bootstrapping multi-billion dollar companies…or circuses!

It used to be a customer-focused company but sadly lost its way.The user interface is deteriorating with each update and there is no way to provide feedback to the company. For example, right now the playback UI is messed up completely and there's no way to communicate the issue back to the company.There is no point of contact literally, apart from Elon's twitter. The old feedback email address was taken down and the contact from in the customer portal only takes you to a number of FAQ articles. No way to send a real message.

nice car, meh customer service

My wife has a leased Tesla model 3 and we thank our lucky stars we didn't buy it outright. Car was delivered new and currently has 700 miles on the clock.We returned home from an 11 day break to an undrivable car, the screen was black, so no reversing cameras, no speedometer, no climate control and the phone apps would no longer connect. Called Tesla twice, the first time they talked me through a soft and hard system reboot, neither worked, the second call to arrange it to be fixed was just infuriating. On a Friday, we were told we'd have to wait until the following Wednesday for Tesla to send out someone to fix it, so we are left a brand new car that we can't use for 5 days. No offer of a courtesy car as Tesla said it is driveable (with no speedometer, heating, reversing cameras?).I'm really appalled with this customer service experience.I'm just glad we didn't drive to the airport to return to a dead car.

A pushy sales agent told me I could take delivery of the vehicle without being in the country as long as I had a Co-registrant added to the policy who was. I was then told I also had to provide a US drivers license, then I was told that actually all policy holders had to be there to take delivery of the vehicle, then I was told to just put the vehicle in someone else’s name and transfer it back to me when I arrive via the DMV (after researching this I discovered that this isn’t even possible without significant charges). Customer service were great before I paid the deposit, after I had paid they were difficult to get hold of, if they responded it was with short unhelpful answers and they were generally dismissive. I think I’ve dodged a bullet overall.

Very disappointed when spending £51K on a car just handed the key and pointed to your plot with very little support was not what I expected, car was less than half charged. I have received better reception from car hire companies!Then mirrors started closing before I could reverse, asked for help, they scheduled a service and cancelled 3 times then they said they contacted me which was a lie! - Will not buy another one!!!!

Please do not buy the hype.  This car needs a lot of maintenance.  I am an actual owner!  Contact me at LeaMeir a Yahoo account if you want to and I will provide with the service history.Did you know that you are not supposed to use certain hair products if you buy this car?  if not, be careful resting your head on the headrest!  No kidding!  do not believe me, It is in the User Manual.  The leather in headrest would bubble and you have to replace if you do!!  Have you ever had to align the rear tires (not the front, the rear) every 6000 miles, even if the CAR IS NEW?? Well, you do for this car!  Had to replace my rear tires after 13000 Miles!!!  Do not even get me started on the Cheap construction.  In the first three months of owning this car, the body frame has come apart three times, the driver seat was dislocated and a whole bunch of other problems.  Rained ONCE and we have to replace the tail lights because of the condensation that crept in!!!!Complete disappointment.  Specially since I love the company.

All has been well for around 11 months and have generally enjoyed the ownership experience. However the test of a company is how well they do when things go wrong. My heater has packed up mid December leaving a freezing car with no windscreen demisting capability ; a pretty serious issue. I've been given a 7 week waiting time to fix due to parts being on back order and no alternative solutions to keep me motoring. Pretty appalling for a £50k car , off road for nearly 2 months because of a parts issue. You cannot quickly get to speak to anyone at the local service center; everything routes through to the central team, who are probably inundated with frustrated motorists with issues. Do I regret the purchase? Yep, sure do - as after-sales is completely substandard and something you should bear in mind if you are considering a purchase or leasing. In general build quality is poor - squeak and rattles and everything feels fragile; which apparently applies to the parts too.

Love the car, hate the customer experience we received while purchasing and post purchase experience/hassle was beyond belief!

IV just received my car and I have to say it is excellent the service has been great and I don’t know why so many people criticise them I strongly recommend them to anyone who wants an amazing car also I love that it’s electric

NON-EXISTENT CUSTOMER SERVICE.   I visited a US dealership and after spending an hour learning about the car I placed an order for a model Y.  The "sales rep" promised me the world- but when I had follow up questions prior to delivery I couldn’t get in touch with a live person.    Tesla does not respond to texts or emails and has no phone number for support.   I had physically return to the dealership to speak with a human (who had originally promised me his contact info but never provided it !) Welcome to the world of “bots”.  Based on this lack of service or accountability  I am not taking delivery of the car and cancelled the order.  Elon Musk can keep my $250.  He may be an engineering genius but he doesn't know anything about customer service.  I’m pretty sure I saved myself years of frustration.  While the car itself seems amazing - Tesla's "Customer Service" is beyond horrible.

I guess it's a random thing, but I'm happy with my Model S. Travel distance is not as they promise, but I expected it. I think all electric car producers promise more than it’s really possible in normal conditions.

Horrible customer services, sent text message and no response, called support and they let you wait forever.

I recently just bought a Tesla, I stupidly bought all the functions i.e FSD (a big scam).Support is close to not existing - the FSD brakes inconsistently, the camera malfunctions and says "blindfolded camera" each time I drive, the wipers always going on, the battery does not offer close to what it displays, I cannot connect properly as I had to use my mobile phone connectivity each time. I am at the latest software upgrade so it's not an upgrade issue........the whole thing about using a Tesla sucks it's a massive risk - I wish I could get a refund

Took yet another day off work to get infotainment upgrade 3rd time. Once again told all the parts were not available.Unable to provide courtesy car as not a warranty issue.Appalling service as usual from Tesla.Will be invoicing them for loss of earnings if not paid will be going through small claims court to issue county court judgment against them.Do not buy a Tesla.

I went on test drive 6 or 7 times.Each time the car had something weird with it, weird sounds, etc. or i seen some damage to saloon, or weird sound, from brakes, or bad saloon quality in a brand new car. no way i am paying such money for such a poor productIf you go and see any 2nd hand car from major manufacturers for the fraction of the cost, of what the new tesla costs, no weird noises, saloon looks okay too

My Tesla is about 6 months old and the rear motor failed two and half weeks ago. I have been tyring get news of when it will be fixed, which is where the Tesla experience is very disappointing and can only be described as non existent. Cannot get through to Customer Services and still waiting for a call back.Leaves you feeling pretty disappointed with a brand which promised so much, but failed to deliver.

For sure at the moment one of the most valuable brand in the world, In my opinion the best electric car for far, the battery autonomy hours it’s very good comparable with others batteries from electric cars

Review:IT IS NOT A QUESTION OF MONEY!                       IT IS A QUESTION OF PRINCIPLE!Tesla's Fort Lauderdale retail/service location ignored our presence at their show room this past Monday.There were 4 Sales Advisors behind a desk to the left of the glass door to the showroom.All four were busy looking at pc and or iPad screens, and none of them acknowledged our presence for about 5 to 7 minutes of us standing about eight feet from them.Then, one whose name we will not motion here, who in the end was polite, asked what he could do for us.We explained that when we got delivery of our second Model S we were not given the second key-fob standardly provided on delivery at that time to any Model S new owner.We explained that we had called Customer service and that a representative said that a note would be placed on our account allowing the service to provide the free key-fob. As he could not find the note, he said that he would text that person internally to confirm.Upon leaving the dealership, as asked by that Sales Advisor, we called Customer Service back and spoke with a person who happened to have the same name as the one we had spoken to that morning. She saw no notes on the account but assured us she would not only type them in but contact via text that Advisor we had just spoken with.Well, last night I received a message, from that Advisor, in which he said they would not do that “because he could not see any authorization on that and that his Management did not want to provide the replacement key fob for free as the “too much time had passed since we purchased the Model S”.Principal:We have been a long-time loyal Tesla owner since 2016, with the plans to exchange our owned Model S for a Plaid Model in the first QT of 2023. The extremely poor and unthought-out decision by the Fort Lauderdale Manager, as we were told, is so unfortunate!It is not business oriented at all that a Tesla Dealership Manager would not provide his customer with a free key fob which at cost for Tesla would represent less than 0.04% of the price of the car we intend to buy!Well, the price that they would charge of $217.75 is not the question here, but what does matters is the fact is that we were not provided with the second fob at delivery of our brand-new Tesla Model S at that time, therefore we should not be incurring in this expense at all. It is a question of principle, not money!For a long time, we have been noticing that Tesla is declining their customer service as originally experienced by us in 2016. It was awesome until we believe 2018!Since them we waited at times almost one hour on the phone to get a representative over the phone, and we were treated with disrespect at least two times at the North Lauderdale Service/Retail branch.At a time in which serious competition, not too much for the model S, is knocking on Tesla’s doors day by day louder and louder it does become crucially important that Tesla pays attention and moves their service to one of the utmost Excellence.We would like the Management at Fort Lauderdale to be aware of what they are doing in terms of customer service, both on the retail and on the service side. On our last visit the speakers were blasting with rock music, so loud that the service representative behind the counter needed to scream at him so that we could understand him and vice versa.The service center looked disorganized and very confusing! On top of that we were ignored also by one of the persons on the second roll of counters, which was a female. She never acknowledged our presence as well. This is unacceptable!We would like to get this situation resolved and obtain the key fob which was never provided to us at delivery by the Dania Beach location (they were awesome to us on any encounter). Too bad that they are now closed!

My battery died and it took the service center two months to find a replacement. During that time I had a lack of communication from their team and had to fight to get a rental unit. At the end, they tried to charge me 150.00 for floor covers that I didn't ask for, I had to call them out and it was embarrassing for everyone involved.

got our second tesla last month. couldn't be happier. i love the improved sound and control system. huge plus if you are into podcast

customer service is non existent. the car ain't worth the risk of all the things that can go wrong, which is everything. and doesn't help that the company is lead badly lately

Res: RN116364513Using my employer's salary sacrifice scheme we ordered a Tesla Model 3 in December 2021 - with an estimated 18-week delivery schedule. Having heard nothing for several months, we phoned Tesla on 11th May, 6th June, 1st September and 15th September to ask about likely delivery. Each time we were reassured our car should be 'on the next shipment'.  But as each delivery estimate came and went, we heard nothing further. At the end of September we emailed Tesla's customer service team to complain about the lack of communication on our order. Our email was sent to a named contact (LH) in the Deliveries team.  Still, we heard nothing further.  We contacted Tesla Customer Services once more who, again, forwarded our email to the Deliveries team. We've heard nothing further. We currently only have an estimated delivery of December 2022 - a year since we placed our order. We appreciate deliveries have been disrupted over recent months.  But Tesla's poor communication and lack of response and interest in customers' legitimate enquiries must, we feel, be due to their incompetence or arrogance (or maybe both). And it's because of this attitude that we wouldn't recommend placing an order unless you're prepared for a long, difficult and stressful experience.

I really like the concept but the page is not loading properly.

One of the best and most reliable electric vehicles. Using model 3 for more than a year, during this time, no problems have been identified.

If I could give Tesla negative stars, they’d get ten.  I made the mistake of leasing a 2022 Model 3 last March. The car is a complete piece of junk - especially compared to my previous Chevy Bolt. Very poor workmanship, a rattle box, and the glitchiest software since Windows 95.  So I found someone to assume the lease.  In June.  It’s now late September and the transfer hasn’t happened yet.  It is literally IMPOSSIBLE to speak with a human being at Tesla about anything. Every phone tree ends the same way “Send an email to… goodbye.”  It is the single most irritating company on the planet.  I’ve emailed the “lease team” about my transfer SEVEN times with ZERO responses to the fact that both me and the new lessee are under sever time constraints on this transfer.  ZERO response.  And no two emails I have received have come from the same person.  Utterly ridiculous.  I would never EVER drive a Telsa vehicle or purchase any of their other products.  All hype and no substance.

Tesla solar does not provide a supervisor to talk to when you need to communicate with them; not even an email. Very impersonal and difficult SYSTEM, then you passively wait for an answer (if they answer).

I leased a Tesla Model 3 ( RN109488293 ) from Tesla, and after returning the vehicle on August 23, 2022, Tesla still charged my bank account $568 for September as if I had not returned the car.I have sent about 30 emails and called many times, but Tesla does not have a real person that answers any of their phones, and I had to leave voicemails.In reply to one of my emails, I finally received a return call from Giselle Acosta, a Lease Maturity Specialist, and she explained that there was some kind of mixup in their system, and when I returned the car, my billing account did not get automatically closed as it should have and that is why I got charged for another month.She said she could not refund me for the $568 charge until the billing department closed my billing account. A week later, I still had not heard anything from anyone at Tesla, and I got another email saying they were going to charge my account again on September 23, 2022, for another $568.I called and left another voicemail but could not speak to a real person, and no one called me back.I sent another email saying I want my money back immediately because it's not my fault they made some kind of mistake and I need the money.I got a reply email saying this:"Any overpayment will go towards your excess wear and tear as well as your end-of-term charges."I replied and said it was not an overpayment! They fraudulently charged me for a car I had already returned, and I want my money back now.I have not heard back or received my refund, and I still can't talk to anyone at Tesla about all of the problems.Its hard for me to believe it is legal for a company to charge me $568 for something I didn't get, and while I do understand mistakes happen, the fact that I cannot talk to anyone about the problem on the phone and they have not refunded me makes the whole thing look very scammy.

The Tesla is a work of art. It's sleek, stylish, and has the power to back up its looks. The Tesla is fast, efficient, and fun to drive. It's the perfect car for anyone who wants the best of both worlds. The Tesla is a great car for anyone who wants a luxurious and practical car. It's a great investment, and I highly recommend it to anyone in the market for a new car.

I had a problem with a shop Tesla order that would have been easy for them to fix. However, after repeated contact attempts by email and no answer within the stated 5 business days, and inability to get a live person on the phone, I will have to go through the expense and hassle of having my bank stop that payment.  They clearly don't want to have contact with their customers.Update - I bumped them up a bit - it took a couple more contacts, but they did send the info to my son so he could access his gift card.

I was able to schedule service very quickly within a few days of a rock breaking our windshield. We received a quote beforehand. The service appointment was quick and the replacement was installed without issue. Great experience!

Purchased 2 Tesla's S & 3 over 9 years. Delivery was seamless. And service has been perfect.. although rarely needed. Only cost has been 2 sets of tires.

Went to a Tesla showroom, hugely impressed and the cars are so modern and sleek. I very much had a great experience and am looking forwards to being able to get one for myself

True test of a company is when something goes wrong. Support is awful. Long delays. (This is not reflection on the staff, they are always polite and helpful) It's the company. Delays in getting things fixed running into months

Car Keeps asking for updates, literally just bought it so why do I have to update it? The fact I have to upgrade the beta system before the FSD works is not good. Acceleration and speed is okay and I like the automated system in the car.

Imagine this. You purchase a long range Model 3 Tesla for all the right reasons. Then, after two weeks, it is taken on its first reasonably long journey. Around 320km and back. The first day of school holidays is a breeze. A stop for coffee for 1.5 hours, all for the environment as the battery charges enough to get 3/4 of the way there. Then, a second stop 2/3 of the way there for half an hour, to pat a baby lamb and top up battery once again. We are only two hours behind and time is not money right? So what used to be a four hour journey is now six and with kids, would feel like nine. Fast forward to the journey home and we are nice and relaxed. We grab a coffee at the nearest town, knowing that there is an EV charge station, so having 90km left is not a problem. When we get to the charge station, we get a message on the Chargefox app that the station has faulted. We try a couple of times to charge, but to no avail. No worries, there are charge stations in every town along the way. The next station is 70km away and we have 90km left. Easy! We leave without a care in the world, until we use the demister to remove vapor from the front window and lose a couple of km. We are still ahead by a few km however things are starting to get tense as we arrive into the next town and head to the EV charge station 5km up. You can imagine our further frustration and concern, when the station is faulted aka not working. We call the local council and the ranger attends. We call Chargefox and they reset the station to no avail yet again. We all begin the head scratching as the problem has escalated into a minor emergency. Eventually, we are pointed toward a motel/lodge that has a wall charger. We plug in, jiggle a lot as the charger does not seem to connect, putting added stress on our environmentally friendly, time costly journey, but manage to dock. The news borders on good. The "car" is finally charging! Just 7 hours until it is fully charged. We decide to grab a coffee at the local cafe. Fortunately, we know somebody in this town or we would be stranded completely and they drive us to the cafe in one of those old fossil fuel cars, that work properly and can attend multiple stations that are not broken. Four hours later, we decide enough is enough. It is now dark, we are against nature, as kangaroos, emus and other animals begin their exploration. We have enough km to get home, so the delusion goes. Almost 300! Our destination is within reach. We head off, enjoying the sun setting over the hills, the silhouette of trees and distant pools of gold looking water. Maybe this is all meant to be, thinks the optimistic, pollyanna fool in me. Since right and wrong do not exist anymore, it is simply us, flawed biology against the perfection of manipulated numbers. Humanity is the issue. As we draw closer to home, I notice two or three km vanish from the screen into the cold night air. Who cares right? We are ahead of the curve. We even stop at a petrol station, stretch, talk to the owner about how they are getting screwed by the system and get some chips, aka fries. The go-cart is a joy to pilot and we are all smiles for a few more expensive km until we trip over a harsh reality. We are somehow in deficit and our destination is now out of range. What do we do? Have no fear, there are cobweb ridden, cable strewn, EV charge stations everywhere. We search up a couple a make a call to a Thai Restaurant, roughly 90km from home and the boss has Covid and is isolating, so we cannot access his cable. So we visit his restaurant, where there may or may not be a charge cable. The glass is half full, so we turn off the highway and head for some culinary delights possibly? Not possible, it's late, they are closing. However the big news is that they have a charge cable. Problems solved without trauma counselling. Excitedly, the restaurant employee wrestles with the combination lock of the charge box, while keeping an eye on customers and I reverse the "car" in gingerly, bordering on exhaustion, pretending to be moderately cognisant. Not long now, we are almost home. The lock box opened, the cable inserted and, wait for it, nothing. The box was green lit, writing cheques the car could not cash. No sale, no charge! Desperation grew. Can we try it again? We had 40km in the bank and our destination was still 90km away. Should we get a room? It is school holidays. Would the car be vandalized if we left it parked somewhere? Can we get a friend to drive 90km to pick us up? It was official, we were stressed. Could we sleep in the car at the restaurant? We began to search for accommodation, since it was late. Nothing! All booked out. But wait, we found another charge station. Such a progressive country we live in. You guessed it, it was faulted. We called Chargefox and got, "sorry it is scheduled for repair soon." To cut a long trauma short, we got towed home! dEVolution!

This review relates to Teslas dreadful after sales service with respect to the provision of spare parts for repair. After a crash in March, parts are not expected to arrive until August. I have found it impossible to find a working complaints procedure. No contact from them despite numerous approaches. The only person I found to talk to advised global parts shortage. Our conversation ended when I pointed out the monthly new car production rates. Great car. Dreadful company.

Love my new Tesla and it is a hit with the whole family. The charging is incredibly simple and there is so much room. My only criticism is I am having display issues with the onboard computer.

After a fantastic test drive we went ahead and placed an order for a Model 3 together with a Tesla Wall Charger. The charger has been installed ahead of waiting for delivery of the car. Unfortunately, the charger has a fault. It makes a constant high pitched noise, even at idle.I have made countless calls and emails over the last few weeks and I cannot get anyone at Tesla to take action to fix this. They either ignore my emails or make excuses and ask I call back later.My car is now ready for delivery, but I am reluctant to accept the car unless the charger issue is fixed. If it cannot be resolved, I would reluctantly be forced to cancel the order for the car.

bought two of them one came about 4 weeks the other one just kept on being pushed back for 6 months now saying another 3 to 5 months. Going to buy a car elsewhere. lost my £100 Deposit terrible customer services they just do not care what so ever would not use.

Be careful if you want to lease a Tesla. usually lease means that you can exchange car for a new model, and of course you can buy the car back at the end of the lease. These terms are used by every car dealer I talked to. Therefore, when I saw different leasing options on Tesla, I selected a model and made a deposit. However, after payment, I received an email from Tesla with a request to proceed with the order. And here it turned out that Tesla's lease is completely different. After the end of the lease period you have to return the car. Exchange for a newer model is not an option at all. You will not find any mentioning of that anywhere on Tesla site while you are making an order. That will be a surprise after you make a deposit. The $250 deposit is non-refundable, so you won't get it back. I didn't receive mine. Fraud? I think it is. Does Tesla care? Seems like they don’t

Appalling customer service, tokk my money, then ignored my complaints. No justification.

Best car ever. Feels like the future! Tesla cars age 10x better than any other cars we've ever owned.

I love my car. Is cost me 120k....... service is pants.no clue college students who could not give a f..k. tesla you should be ashamed..... lack of training your staff could not care less. AND NO IDEA WHAT THERE DOING

Model y is such an an Amazing vehicle!!!!

Still no response from Tesla regarding car parts. Beginning to loose faith. Will o ever get car back.

My model 3 was delivered a while back, after a long wait. It has exceeded my expectations in every aspect. I think there could be potential service delays etc but given how little service is expected at Tesla, I was willing to make a compromise. For me safety and simplicity is paramount and that is where these cars absolutely shine.

Avoid avoid avoid Cars are not fit for rd… service is awful… customer service non existent Please read reviews before purchasing!

I had a positive experience with delivery my Tesla model 3. The problem is with their courier DHL. Why on earth Tesla uses the worst delivery service in UK (same level as Hermes)? I ordered a new card and an accessory for the central console. Paid online, didn’t receive any confirmation. Called customer service to get a tracking number or at least know when the parcel will be delivered. A young lady said she would make sure I received the info needed. Nothing happened. 4 days later DHL tells me they will deliver today by the end of the day, no better indication. I spent all day in. Now it’s 7:30pm and I am not sure i will see my parcel today and tomorrow I cannot spend another full day in. I could change my delivery to a safe place (my shed) but they require (probably Tesla requires) a signature. Aaaargh… Be smart, be better.Or simple use Royal Mail that does a good job consistently.

Picked up my car in March (had to drive 3h round trip to pick it up as they wouldn't deliver!). Car is a really lovely piece of engineering, really happy with it... BUT... There were some paintwork issues that I've got them to try and address and they couldn't care less and have wasted my time getting me out to their service centres (not local!) without fixing. Service is absolute shambles, especially when you're paying this much for a vehicle. I'd definitely consider a competitor in future.

Their service is garbage. I ordered my car a few months ago. They assigned me a sales associate, which canceled my order without notifying me. At the beginning, I booked my car with my Chinese tesla account, which has a Chinese tesla vehicle in this account. However, since American account is completely different from the Chinses account, there is no way I can transfer. At the very first beginning, the sales asked me to merge my account without explaining, which will cause my Chinese tesla unbind to any account. Later he asked me to cancel my order and reorder without detailed description. I said yes and he canceled my order. That's it. If I reorder, my 250 deposit of my previous order is gone, and I have to accept the new price. FML.Never ever order from ONLINE. never everrrr!!!!

My Tesla X is definitely a great car.  I love the design and the acceleration is amazing compared to my Gasoline vehicle.  The car buying experience was fun... a whole different process compared to traditional Car Dealerships.Extremely happy with my purchase... the only area where Tesla can improve is in the Service Department.  I have to drive quite a distance to my designated Service Location.  Hopefully they will add more locations in the future.Overall, awesome car.  Love it!

Ordered a new model 3 with an estimated delivery of Feb, app updated to say estimated delivery in June so I paid my £6000 deposit, 2 days after it reverted to Feb. So now you have my money I'm not a priority?

Model S owner and have enjoyed the car very much.  I took the car in to have a handle fixed when the car had circa 99,000 miles on the clock, and Tesla decided to do something with the battery, despite the car never haven given me any warning that there was a problem in the previous six years.  Since they did something with the battery I have had constant problems.  They have had the car in for days on end without even suggesting to offer me a replacement car, and then tell me that there is no problem with the car.  There clearly is, as the photos and videos that I send them highlight.It appears to me more than a coincidence that these problems have only arisen since they did something with the battery.  I would like to think it is sheer incompetence on their part.  But whatever it is, Tesla I have now been stranded on the side of the road on four occasions in the last two months, two of which have required road side assistance.  As soon as the 12V battery is jumped, the car starts again.  And no, I have not let the battery run down.I now have literally no confidence that the car will get me home if I take it anywhere.  And surely that is a basic requirement of any car.

I have a 2019 Tesla Model 3 Long Range, AWD.  Had minor service in Vaughan, ON to pickup mud flaps.  Customer rep was great.  I also had service in Vancouver, BC, Canada and service was great when I had concerns with my brakes.

Tesla UK Customer Services is really awful. My brand new Model 3 was damaged (through no fault of mine) and needed a new front wing. More than two months on and the ETA has just been extended to the end of April - a further 4 weeks, with no guarantees it will arrive then. The UK contact centre were no help whatsoever and simply referred me to the parts depot in Europe. Apparently they are unable to contact them on behalf of a customer. I don’t know why. I tried to escalate the matter, but it’s impossible. The emails simply go back to the same unhelpful team, who do nothing. Senior execs., it would appear, either don’t exist, or if they do, they consider themselves too high and mighty to communicate with their customers. Happily, Karl Vella managed to find me the necessary part from within their own business and were able to repair my car, but it was no thanks to Tesla. I realise that there are many issues affecting supply chains just now, but Tesla’s lousy communication and ‘couldn’t care less’ approach is unforgivable.In short Teslas are great cars, but the experience is ruined by the lack of a decent support network in the UK.PS - Another cause for complaint - Referral Miles Fiasco:I ordered my car whilst the referral miles offer was in place and using the link that I had been given by another Tesla owner. The miles were not added. 6 months on and, despite sending them a screenshot of the actual WhatsApp conversation in which I received the link, they replied insisting that no link was used and, by implication, saying that I had lied. They would not accept that their computer system could possibly have been at fault, even though one of their own colleagues had admitted that my experience was not unique.I actually don’t use their supercharging network much, as there are none close to my home, but, on principle, if something is offered, the offer should be honoured. This company produces very good cars, but it shows no concern whatsoever for its customers and it’s impossible to escalate a complaint. Personally, I have never come across anything as bad as this.

Currently at the WPB FL Tesla service. Windshield replacement with a 10:30 appt. They did not inform me ahead of time that they would need it all day. I have a trip tomorrow and cannot Teag schedule so decided to wait. On the app it says 7pm finish time. Service personal is professional but there is a lack of communication on the app. When the service appt I scheduled they should inform customer to drop off the car for the day instead of waiting. A 10:30 appt fir a windshield should not take more than two hours. It is now 1pm and they just told me it could be a couple more hours. Easy fix, better communication with specific tunes for repairs when appt is scheduled. Tesla service is no frills. Clarity of duration of appt ahead of time would greatly help.

Legendary tesla customer service lives upto its name.Had to go and collect my tesla from Southampton today and when I got there, after much searching in their car park they worked that the car was at Heathrow.Apparently they sent me text last night, but the text failed to send! Somehow that was a valid excuse.So wasted journey for 3 hours and now on my way back home. Who knows if I will ever get the car.Oh and I was told when I was there they are removing the helpline phone number as toomany people are calling it.

very high quality , comfortable and also very but very expensive

Great cars, awesome brand but pathetic customer service. I owned my Tesla Model Y for less than 72 hours before it developed a software fault and could no longer be driven. Support were useless and just recited what we had already read on the support website. Finally the car was recovered to Tesla Chelmsford. Rang several times and promised a call back and update. Nothing! They have had my car 7 days and don’t even have the common courtesy to return a call. I have no vehicle and no eta on getting mine fixed. I am so disappointed in Tesla. A premium car company yet they treat their customers with contempt once they have your money. Owning a  Land Rover for the last four years I know what good customer service looks like:  Tesla have a lot to learn from their competition when it comes to post sales. After my experience I would seriously reconsider  purchasing a Tesla. I now have zero confidence in the car and brand going forward:

24 Hours after driving away in a model Y and it's back at Tesla with a fault a software upgrade could not fix!UPDATE 25/03/2022PAID £59,000 OUTRIGHT FOR MODEL Y, AND NO CAR!I've put a couple of posts on since Monday, basically picked up my new Y on Sunday, within hours noticed a fault with the sound, everything stopped working. indicator tone, reversing tone, music, phone, everything. Took the car back on Monday, had t confirmed today that the main computer needs to be replaced but they are on back order with no know due date! So hey have my money and my car. If I cancel they wont allow me to order another for 12 months. They won't replace it like for like. So the legal route seems the only option now if I still want a Tesla, question is, do I still want one? 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬Worst car experience I've ever had! First world problem I know!

Fantastic demo drive...whoaa  goes like a rocket. Bought one on the day. Now ready to collect my new Tesla Model Y on 28th Mar from Manchester Trafford centre.The buying process has been perfect to date.The car production has been moved from America (due to poor quality build) to Shanghai. Its an expensive  chinky loo take away!Fingers crossed nice new car with no defects - we will see.Ordered the homelink option which they say can be installed at home via their mobile service.Im sooo excited...what can possibly go wrong??...to be updated.

I paid the deposit and then it all went pear shaped. I was told that my car would be delivered because I was paying cash. Then I was told that I had to collect it 100miles away! Then the collection 100 miles away was just confirmed unilaterally. You can't get hold of a real person to talk too. I had to go in store with my concerns. If anything were to go wrong further down the line I would experience the same? Tesla has no infrastructure to deal with customer service really. The service was awful!. Customers aren't valued. Take it or leave it tone. I cancelled. I am use to amazing Audi customer service. Don't believe the hype relating to Tesla!

Tesla after sales non existent!Auto Pilot has stopped working and despite repeated calls and emails I don't get any resolutions from Tesla!Extremely disappointed and angry!

Tesla Energy has really pushed the bar in terms of providing poor customer service. They have repeatedly and reliably managed to deliver what is hands-down the WORST experience of any product I have ever purchased. I can't even count how many times they have failed to follow-up or flat out ghosted me. They make the cable company a much more highly desirable experience, which is pretty pathetic.

Picked up my car yesterday From the Glasgow centre and asked why the car was not washed after the repair. By the way Tesla canceled 2 appointment prior to the appointment. I was told Tesla do not wash cars I questioned this and said I have owned both BMW & Mercedes and they always completely wash and vacuum the car.  I was told that BMW and Mercedes are premium brands in what can only be a very supersilliois manner by the service member of staff.  Told that Tesla is a  technology company not a premium vehicle. Hey I thought I bought a premium vehicle when I handed over £50k.

Yay, just bought some Merch with Doge, how cool is that.

Ok don't get me wrong tesla cars are great and all but at -10°C it goes bonkers the key doesn't work the palm recognition thing doesn't work I literally had to blow at it for 30 Minutes straight just for it to open the car...

Tesla sell cars that break apparat during normal use. Model S and Model X should have a recall for control arms that break. Really dangerous problem. May end up with fatal outcome. When Car collapse Tesla may claim that the reason is user csused and refuse to cover costs (warranty or goodwill). Many owners experience ridiculous quality problems. Company makes products fart but neglecting quality issues. Customer service is extremely poor. Get a good lawyer if you buy a Tesla!

i got my car after 1 year of waiting, and it worthed it lmao :;DDDD

awful trade in offer. 5k less than i recieved on an internet trade in website

Tesla promise more supercharger locations om there web page. Some they just remove after 6 months of waiting (Nørre Aaby - Denmark). Others are still promised but placed in locations that are impossible to build (Odense by Rosengårds Center)Please be thoughtful Tesla

Just got my Model Y! It's so fast

My experience is about being a non starter. I filled in all the online information they asked for, even got a response....once, contacted the local powerwall installers and got one reply after about 3 weeks saying they were too busy right now! They are supposed to be the front runners in all things battery powered. I am not quite sure where that leaves us moving forward......anyone got some batteries and a soldering iron?

Very bad experience in EUROPE service work!!!Vienna or Praque the worst services.

Tesla stealing government tax incentives given to people to buy EV to fight climate change. After Biden's administration new law about giving back incentives to buy electric vehicles Tesla rose their cap prices so they would get every new potential purchaser's incentive pie. I wanted to get their long time wanted model Y, but seeing how price jumped from $$53k to $59k canceled my reservation losing $250 non-refundable deposit. Otherwise, $6,000 out of $8,000 incentive would end up in Elon Mask's pocket rather than mine.

You cannot access your solar panel account on the website.  Your options are...buy solar, buy used Tesla or buy new Tesla car.  We had to pay $17k to get out of the contract, they would not take back the equipment. The price of the buyout never amoritized or lowered over 8 months!  What is that about! New buyers did not want the solar panels.  It nearly killed the sale of the property.  To speak with someone via phone, you wait minimum of 1 hour and still get nowhere.  I would never buy a Tesla anything due to their poor customer service.  I cannot imagine how bad these cars are if they cannot have a decent website. So inept.  Good Riddance!

Ordering was smooth and delivery time was some what right. My model y long range is awesome

Order model y Performance  on 8/15/2021and done all documents also estimated day is 7 weeks but bow delay 3 times every time is 1 month. Right now estimates day is to December. Call Tesla service they say you done on your side only wait for us call because they have problems with productions line. Order thing get me mad is one of my friend order after my order and estimates time on 2022 but he just got the car last week 😖

As the owner of two 2021 Tesla Performance models, I have nothing but praise for the company. These two cars are flawless and smoke everything off the line and on a curvy mountain road.

Tesla X. Only two year old car. About 14 times inbthe garage. Rattling, vibrations, screen keeps switching off, doors wont open, camera is down, sensors keep acting funny, wheel worn just after 30k km becouse I was advised to drive on lower suspension by tesla worker. Over all one star for tesla its one to many

Probably one of the worst companies that I have ever worked for. Wouldn’t suggest going there to buy a car either. You can do everything from home and don’t need to speak to anyone as they won’t give you good advice anyway. Managers are pointless and never around and as an ex-employee I am disgusted by how they treat their employees. Nothing but a number - make sure you get paid before you leave too as that’s another issue.

Very worring when tesla cant/wont even fix their own car, they have had the car for 13 weeks for a knocking sound now they have given the car back not fixed but saying it is a "characteristic of the car" not something I have ever found with any other car maker... every problem is always swept under the carpet and within "Tesla spec". from loaner cars with no MOT to the Finacial service teams that never call back... I did check reviews before I purchased it and thought there cant be that many unhappy people .... how wrong could I Be, wish I never brought it and stuck with mercedes.

I love my car but it's very hard to reach support and the person i spoke to was rude to me.

Reached out to Tesla Customer care to check on the status on my delivery, one customer care was rude, second just paying $100 does not count you have to select payment in advance and I was not informed about this when I check again for delivery. I booked in July 2021 and expected delivery was October 2021. Today when I check back expected delivery is March- April 2022. because I did not choose payment method.   Really dissapointed with the service glad not choosing tesla now.

bought a tesla since the early beginning continue to buy every car they release bright future for tesla

Low trust for the SW in Tesla M3.Upgrade of SW during night prevent me from going to work with my Tesla the next morning. Upgrade has failed with warnings, malfunctioning of several SW features etc.No support was able to be given me when I called. I got a "I am sorry!" and NO actions on how to get to work.This is an extremely expensive car to own, you need to either have a back-up car or spend the money for cab when SW upgrades are failing. Also if you are working, you will miss work due to SW upgrades.What was really clear to me was the there is NO ownership from Tesla when they do SW upgrades and put their customers in this situation.

I love this car! Never using another brand ever again.

"Your car is as good as its service is" ... well:In short: unreachable unresponsive dealers were pushy and aggressive when they communicated. By the delivery it turned out that the license plate on the car was registered to a different person - do they sell expensive cars or potato?They were careless about my needs and were pushing to keep the car to be delivered in Q3 but not on a date that was optimal for me. Because of their missing flexibility I had to leave earlier my severely sick relative behind and buy earlier flight ticket just to catch up with the date _they_ wanted me to pick up the car.Before that day they didn't answer mails, didn't pick up calls. When they answered sometimes it turned out that what they told it was not true.On site during I was checking the new car (which had 37% only instead of promised 50+) the sales guy came to me telling that I won't go home with that car ...When they saw my disappointment I was told that my complaints will be forwarded to the management. Later it turned out that they did nothing just promised that.Even when I bought my cheapest car I received a much better service without these horrific events.Completely unreliable+unresponsive service/company.(at the site they offered a test car to get home and told that in 2-3 days they will come to my home to exchange to the car that I ordered -- one week later when they responded on my 3rd mail they called this as compensating ...)

Before I purcahsed my tesla model3, I have never been informed that Fully autonomous driving is illigal in the UK. After I purchased, I have realised it does not even work properly. So, I called tesla and I was informed its illigal in UK to use it. When I asked for my money back, I have been denied refund with in 14 days of the purchase, blaming its a business purchase, so no refund. I am very upset that I bought something that is illigal to use it in UK, how they are allowed to even sell it here? After my complaint this is the reply i was given:"Tesla Customer Service UK & Ireland customer under score sign service under score sign uki at sign tesla.com(had to write the sign name, no special character allowed on trust pilot) Apr 22, 2021, 5:33 PM to meDear Kazi,Thank you for your prompt response.Please be advised your vehicle is enabled with full self-driving capabilities and the currently enabled features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous.All new Tesla cars have the hardware needed in the future for full self-driving in all circumstances.

I've had my Tesla Model 3 Performance for 1 year now, and it's time to give a little review, it's bar none the best car I have had.The service is also fine and quite easy via the App.My car is perfect and have no issues at all even after 44k km in one year :) I only changed wiper fluid some times! I've tried serval other EVs, but theres nothing out there yet that beats this.

I’ve had my model 3 for a couple of months now. I’ve had some issues which were ironed out by service. Overall I love this car and can never go back to a petrol car.

My Tesla model X wasn’t  charging at home. I brought it to Plano service center and was told that nothing wrong with the car charging port or my home charger. I took the recommendation of having my electrical work at home checked out. I paid electrician $500 to change the breaker, wires, outlet but nothing fixed the problem. After back and forth with another service center, I got a new home charger and the problem was resolved. Had they recommended that solution of changing to the  gen 3  charger first, I would have saved a lot of time, money, and above all the inconvenience.

Best car buying experience ever from Jack at Winchester,England Tesla. I’ve walked out of other brands showrooms after the disinterest shown. Tesla and Jack was in a different league. My debit card has never been out of my wallet more quickly. And that says a lot coming from me, believe me.

I’m on my second Tesla, an S first and now a 3 and they’re great cars. They have their irritations for sure - my 3 is always panicking and loudly beeping about something or other in ways that seem impossible to turn off - but both of my cars have been well built and reliability seems high. The uk Tesla Store (for accessories) isn’t so hot - their tracking is poor and they seem hard to contact - but overall I think it’s a pretty good company.

I’m an existing customer wanting to buy a new Tesla. Went to Cheltenham. Big mistake. Some obnoxious individual called Mark was there. Super self obsessed and complete waste of space. Let’s just saw BMW just sold me a car. Peace and calm.

I bought a new car yesterday, a Tesla model "S". It's excellent, I have no words! 5* for this company!!

This is my 2nd Tesla. Just switched from a model 3 to a model s. Overall the model s is a better car. It’s more comfortable to drive and has great load capacity Key part of getting the best out of an electric car especially  in the case of Tesla is the charger network and how fast the car charges which in my opinion is superior as it links into the cars sat nav identify charger stations and if they are in use. The charger speed is very fast and covers key routes, though the further north you go they could do with more stations or York , hill.this is a big selling point having a dedicated network and something they shouldn’t change. You can still charge on other networks and at home but the speed I generally superior at the superchargers.Only negative I would mention. Don’t rely on the summon feature it’s very temperamental, it works better in the model 3

Excellent design, unique experience

Tesla make fantastic cars and a lot of them, many of which go to third party leasing companies. Here’s where they fall short, Tesla sell upgrades & subscriptions within the Phone App unfortunately when you lease a car these functions are turned off. Which bright spark at Tesla thought this one up, how much is this costing Tesla in after sales.

Over the last 5 years the customer service has gone from great to terrible back to good.  Trying to digitise car servicing in £80k+ cars was a huge mistake, especially comared to Mercedes/BMW/Jag/Porsche etc, but the guys at Newcastle are great!My only real complaint is the eye watering rates for their mechanics £175/hr is ridiculous...ended up costing me £400 for air con refill, I could have have got from local company for about £150!

I paid Tesla $16k to install solar at my home.  They finished the installation in the first week of May.  It's now been 8 weeks and they still haven't submitted the paperwork to my utility company to to turn the system on.Their customer service is absolutely terrible.  When you buy solar from Tesla they assign you to a project advisor.  I've called my advisor countless times and have never gotten through to him, nor has he returned any of my calls or e-mails.To make matters worse, my roof recently started leaking in the area they installed the panels.  Tesla offers a warranty on roof leaks, but unsurprisingly I haven't been able to get in contact with anyone for the warranty claim.If you're having solar installed don't even consider Tesla.  The poor workmanship and nonexistent customer service isn't worth the cost savings.

I never much liked cars, but for some reason I find myself constantly on the road in my Tesla and I absolutely fell in love with it.

Good cars (I have an S) but customer service is atrocious. When something inevitably goes wrong, even if it is quite minor, it is incredibly expensive/frustrating /difficult/time consuming to get it fixed. Last Tesla I will buy.

Buying my Telsa was the best thing I ever did (sorry wife and children, you are next on the list) :o)

I absolutely love my Tesla.  Great experiences from beginning to end.  They are really revolutionizing the car buying experience.

Love Tesla & Elon MuskLove Tesla and Elon Musk, but they need to improve support service, especially for their car division. People spend a lot of Money on Tesla cars and deserve good customer support.

Tesla’s products have recently suffered the same problems as his boss, and have been kidnapped

Elon, you don't know the first thing about Crypto, gtfout the crypto space and stop manipulating your pump and dumps.

I never buy a Tesla ...Musk great speculator for his own interests .moron musk ...poor crypto and tesla investors

The energy levels showed that everyone is confident that its the right direction they are moving towards.

Former Solar City:  I have a prepaid lease for 20 years.  My inverter has been broken for a month.  While they will repair the inverter, they say tough luck on the roughly $50-100 of lost energy credits which I will not have for the winter when there is no sun.  I also had to push them several times to schedule a repair.  They knew it broke weeks ago, but did not tell me or schedule a repair until I called them several times.  They are very customer unfriendly.

Amazing company very happy with Tesla model 3.

Can't wait to buy one ;) my uncle has a Tesla and he lets me drive it sometimes, definitely will be getting one

I own two Tesla's. Model X and a Model 3. The cars are good although the final fit'n'finish is sub-standard. You do get a lot of tech though.The reason for the 2 star is the after sales service. It is simply appalling. For the last 3-4 years Tesla owners have put up with unprofessional service - whether that's in dealing with scheduling a service, or even getting hold of someone, or with warranty work or paid upgrades. It really is very amateur.Tesla is the wealthiest car manufacturer in the world. It is time that they put some serious money behind their customer service capabilities. They cannot continue to rely on their tech to remain competitive.Car went in for some paid upgrade work. Got it back with wires hanging out, a plastic shroud hanging over the accelerator pedal, and the dash itself not fixed back properly. I am not joking when I say that they let an apprentice technician work on my car without any final QC from someone more experienced.While my family waited I had to get them to put my car back together the way that I left it with them.Whilst I think its great that Tesla let you upgrade components (I had the MCU2 upgrade done) its always a roll of the dice with what you're going to get back.

Great Car, amazing brand, never tried anything close to it.

A few business lease queries were answered promptly and succinctly by the Glasgow team after hours.

Worst experience ever.  My wife was contacting multiple solar companies in the area and Tesla was one we figured we'd try.  Everything seemed easy until she actually spoke with a live person.  From there it went downhill.  They were rude and wouldn't directly answer any specific questions we had.  Would not recommend going solar with them unless you want a hard time.

We were excited to buy our new Tesla (2020 Model 3). However, when we went to pick it up (drove 45 minutes), we waited over two hours before they told us that the car wasn’t there. We then had to wait five days before it arrived. We purchased an adapter to allow the car to charge faster. The sales person there insisted that it was the right one. However, it did not fit the receptacle and found out on the web that we needed a different one. We tried calling Tesla to find out how we could exchange the adapter, but it was nearly impossible to get through to someone. We finally got someone on the phone and two people assured us that if we take it back to the place where we picked up the car and purchased the adapter, they would reimburse us. So we drove another 45 minutes merely to find out that they would not refund us for the adapter. The sales person there recommended that we sell it on Ebay. So not only was it frustrating getting a hold of customer service, but we were also lied to. Our general experience is that after the sale of the car, Tesla no longer cares about its customers. It is nearly impossible to get an answer from them for any service. Employees are misinformed and not helpful. We recommended Tesla to friends but after our customer service debacle they are changing their minds and are now considering competitive EVs that are slowly gaining ground on Tesla.

would never buy a car from the company of a guy that calls a child Savior a "pedo guy" Doubt most of these people's reviews are even legit, one of them says they "purchased a tesla x" yet complain about the price of a Nintendo switch. Yeah right not buying it.

Hope I can buy one some day.To Mars, and electric vhicles for all!

Revolutionary idea, formidable charging network, but constructively mediocre car and incompetent and arrogant assistance network (they are the tesla fundamentalists, only they are good ...), not to mention optional paid thousands of euros that disappear by magic with an update or maintenance interventions that replace entire MCUs making you pay thousands of euros while the component to be replaced was a few hundred. This is my opinion gained in two years as a Tesla customer, the future I see in the car is the kindle with wheels, in which everything will be paid for ... the ideal solution for now is to rent it, with full insurance

fault after fault from delivery, drove through a puddle and it burnt out, you'd think id ditched it in a lake the way they went on, it was 4 inches of water, took 6 weeks to fix, the came back with panel not clipped back, a USB stick in the drinks holder, they fitted the glove box back and forgot to refit the socket so just shoved the stick there, charger lead went missing seats move over night on ther own, just very poor

Love my model S so much, the acceleration and range are beyond anything else in the marketplace right now. So impressed with the technology and the autonomous driving. Well worth the investment

Great riding experience, especially autonomous driving experience

NO CAR CAN COMPETE ? BYE BYE COMBUSTION CAR MANUFACTURES! TESLA CARS ARE AMAZING AND CHEAPER TO RUN!HELP TELSA PRODUCE MORE !!!I test drove this car few times, on the UK pre-release. I booked a test drive then convinced my pal to hired one for 6 months they are great.We love innovation but were not expecting the advances offered by a Tesla.  These cars are literally a game changer and has forced every car company and technology company in the world to change focus lol.I haven't done work for Tesla yet, but I can assure everyone that there technology will impact everyone in some way shape or form.  Wether it is in the form of environmental improvements that are far reaching to the average car owner.  However if you are a Car Mechanic? Very soon you will be left squabbling, if they don't modernise!!!BTW .... YOU CANNOT BUY HONESTY !!!!

This rating is not essentially for the car itself but rather the behaviour, set up and sheer incompetence of Tesla UK staff. I paid £48,440 for a new Model 3. It's not Merc or BMW quality, but more like a Mondeo standard (the plastic plates on the front door frames came off after a few days as they hadn't been glued down properly). They won't deliver it to your nearest Tesla dealer and expect you to travel the country to pick it up. I was asked if I would travel 200 miles (which I pointed out was against the law due to lockdown rules).  The car itself though is a dream to drive and a credit to Elon Musk. Now the real gripe. I was offered 1 years free supercharging but got charged when I used it on 31st Dec so I queried this with the salesman. He told me that the system was that I would be contacted later in January when the benefit went 'live' and not to worry, as I would get 1 year from then. I didn't use the superchargers deliberately and charged only from home in anticipation of this communication. 7 weeks later in late Feb, I realised I still hadn't been contacted and so called the salesman and reminded him of the conversation. He said he would look into it and get back 'by the end of the week'. Which he didn't. So I had to chase him again. After some email exchange where he apologised for 'mis-communication' he told me that the years benefit had in fact started on 1st Jan. As this was their mix up and misinformation to me, I requested that I should simply be given the free year from that date (17th Feb). This was refused and I was told it was 'not possible' (Elon Musk put a car in orbit in the asteroid belt, but changing the years supercharging date is apparently an impossibility). This isn't a large amount of money but the sheer arrogance of the company in creating a problem for their customer and expecting the customer to pay for it gives me a really bad 'feel' about this company. They have the arrogance of BMW/Merc/Audi salesmen of the 1980's when high flying executives were queuing up for their quality company cars. "Your so lucky to have one of our incredible pieces of engineering, just get in the queue"....... As things stand, I won't buy a Tesla again and I will share my bad experience of this company with anyone who asks me what I think of the new car.

I'm a very happy Tesla customer. Very easy, smooth order process, professional delivery, great car and very friendly personnel!

Beware!! Tesla London UK multimillion dollar company sells cars with abominal, reckless after service!Three years after the fact, wasting my time on numerous phone calls regarding my wall mount Tesla charger they did not take responsibility to replace it. Instead they claimed it was installed wrong under someone they recommended. They have the audacity to say it is my fault. From issues with doors to windows malfunctioning everything becomes days of correspondence with no service, only excuses.

I am a totally deflated and brow beaten buyer of a 2021 Tesla model 3 (i reject labelling myself as an owner since that conjures up visions of pride - of which I have none for this US brand). I urge anyone who is considering buying this car to think again and look elsewhere. My car is riddled with unacceptable issues. Delivered with only 8 miles on the clock SEVEN (7) panels are miss-aligned to ridiculous levels. It would seem the car was dragged off the ship, put on a low-loader and sent to me.. No prep, no checks, no consideration.. Cameras not working, rear seats with stains, headlining with stains, alloys scuffed, bumpers (fenders for US) different paint shade to the rest of the car.On top of that, Telsa registered my car in the wrong name. They are really difficult to deal with and it's like walking in treacle just to get someone to take responsibility and ownership.The car now has 200 miles and it's up for sale. Dreadful US company with lowest standards of quality and service. If I owned stock, I would sell since the company is not ready for the mass market.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED

7 months and still waiting for my solar panels. Everything with this company is late and never really lives up to the hype. My tesla suv has been nothing but a headache that I waited 4 months for. Its more high maintenance than a crazy girlfriend with none of the perks. Come on tesla, when will you guys figure out how to build things and keep commitments?

Love Tesla & Elon Musk, but they need to improve customer service, especially for their car division. People spend a lot of Money on Tesla cars and deserve good customer support.

Recently Elon has become the richest person as a surge in stock prices, but I always wanted to thank Elon musk and Complete team working on renewable energy products. They were already the most admired around the world, they dont need monetary boost.

I've just bought Tesla model 3, and I found out its customer services are so poor. My sale supervisor doesn't listen to me and read my mail, she makes me lose time and rush to file all documents to get loan from Tesla before delivery. Used to be Tesla fan, but now they're making me down. I feel upset because it's not what I expected how poor services they deliver to me as a present for 2021.

Utterly appalling service.  I have bought a "brand new" car from the New page on the Tesla web page. I live and work in London.1) Tesla is unable to deliver a new car in London (you might know it, that little town in the south of England). The best they can offer for delivery is a car park outside a funfair somewhere in Chertsey. This is for an £80k car.2) I bought this car on their "New cars" page. But it turns out to be not new at all, it has 6,000 miles on the clock and probably previous owners.3) I paid my deposit on November 10th (£8k). I expected delivery in a week or so and they confirmed this. Then they told me they could not deliver for some reason. Then they told me my "New" car was in fact damaged. It is now 11 weeks later and I have no idea when I will get my car.I have heard that Elon Musk likes to smoke marijuana. As far as I can tell, the entire staff of his company seems to be on drugs as well judging by their level of service.

Really help full Rcmiane and Shewin working in Tesla Hanger Lane London.there is small space under touch screen in model X and my phone was stock in there by there help they took the phone out as you all know in this generation we can’t be relax with out phone ☺️ thanks to this guys really appreciate 😊

Picked up brand new Model 3 from Tesla Chelmsford, had glue residue on both doors and seat which they have now got to send someone out to change door interior panels. 3 hours later car breaks down with a 12v Battery fault, have the stickers still left on the car, no quality control checking at all. Complete disgrace

I bought a second hand (2017) Tesla S and immediately applied to have the car allocated to me.  I tried this on line and I sent 2/3 emails, and never got an answer.  After 4 weeks I managed to get through to their Sales team and wihle someone was trying to help me an email came through to say that my application was beign dealt with (referene an email I sent one week before).  One week later I have heard nothing yet again and am now 10 minutes into waiting on the phone.  They have no interest in providing service by email or phone. I've not had the chance to use it but it seems you cannot use a lot of the phone features without the car being linked to your account.One fed up owner.

I was treated like a number. Nobody cared about me being a person. I was lied to in order to make the purchase. It may have just been my experience but I was not told the truth about my trade in. They then surprised me with a 2000 dollar bill. I would have sold my car to carmax had I known that they would don this. I am very disappointed. I was excited to get my car. Now I am just very disappointed I was lied to. I took lyfts and ubers to only drive less than 1k miles I was promised my estimate was good for.

Best of the best. 5 star service all the way. Thank you. Highly recommended.

My door handle was stuck again and their helpful mobile service team came out and fixed it this morning even before I had my cuppa

Amazing product for what is a new technology on a though industry. Very happy with Tesla so far

Great car but lots of minor quality issues all over the car. It absolutely ruins the fun of driving it!I got delivery of my Tesla Model 3 in September 2020, have been to the London Heathrow Tesla Service Centre twice and there are still lots of quality issues.The service centre workshop staff are so careless. Everytime I leave the car there is comes back with lots of other issues! I have requested for official complaint procedure, I have lost so many work hours travelling to their service centre and the quality of their work on anything is completely rubbish!

I got a Model S Its a really great car the only thing is that it has 3G  and when you search something up it takes 5 mins to load...could we have at least 4G? that's why 4 stars instead of 5.

Great cars. Great service. Love my Tesla.

I have a model 3, and love it.  I will never buy another non-Tesla car.  Going back to gas cars is like riding a horse.  I wanted to dislike it because of the hype, but couldnt.  You have to drive it to believe.

Peeling off your TESLA MODEL S - The Tesla factory "forgot" to add the coating below the paint of the car. Professional painters are chocked. Is it under Tesla warranty? No is saying Tesla. 😠 Probably Elon likes it better in raw Aluminium.watch youtube /watch?v=6q75FEc6buA

Great car, crap customer service!The car is great but you can not ignore the customer service and after sales issues. Car delivered with damaged panels and misaligned parts, took 6 months to fix after at least 4 service visitsAuto steer is practically useless apart from the motorway, even on the motorway if there are faded lines in the road it will steer them into other lanes.TACC is useless on city streets and causes phantom breaking all the time, so this means cruise control is barely usable.Local service centres have no control over the software so you are left at the will of the programmers in america to fix your car when they see fit.The software updates often break things like currently the issue is that autosteer now limits your speed to what it *thinks* is the speed limit that is often wrong. So you could be stuck with a limit of 30mph on a 70mph road due to its *intelligent* speed limit recognition.Far too many fans on social media doing things for attention and clicks, quoting stock prices and shorting who will ignore the actual facts that the company is far from perfect.The product itself is great hence 2 stars not 1.

The vehicle is great and the after sales service is being existing so far. Worst car buying experience I have ever had.I had mine handed over in a hotel car park and got the 2 keys in a plastic bag... I leased the car over 4 years on a PCH agreement,  and paid 20k upfront and will be paying a grand a month from now on, it felt like a low-end rent-a-car experience and you would not expect this for such money.The lack of fancy new car hand-over experience, not being given at least key rings...it's something. can live with, I am missing it though :)On the positive side, the "metal bit" is nice, has plenty of issues, came with some damages, but even in these conditions I am still in love with it.As soon as I put my foot down, I forget about all the issues. Well done Elon and the tech guys!As well, service department in Tesla Dartford, UK have been great so far, as I said, the car has many issues and they have been on the situation so far with good communication and not-that-outrageously-long waiting times I heard about on some other fellow Tesla drivers.Tesla can be a great car manufacturer only if it is willing to listen more to the consumers...have an option to send feedback from the app directly or from the car.I am still waiting for 360 degrees surround view from the cameras so I can park "the van" easier;If we are tied on a 20m distance because of the EU regulation, Summon should happen via WI-FI or so, not GPS as the GPS in iPhone sucks so the Summon never works for me in real life.Service-wise, I dropped mine 4 days ago to fix some defects it came with: damaged driver's door panel, some sensors on the rear left door which forbid the Model Xmas to perform and see traffic moving erratic and some other sensors...I gave up on the Summon function as they are blaming it on the iPhone 11 Pro Max's GPS not being on the exact spot or so...I keep on receiving texts telling me that work on the vehicle will start as soon as a technician will be available...so they asked me to come in on a specific day, I did so but there is no technician available...so professional...not.I have been given a loan car for the time being and it was filthy. I was never given a replacement car in such a poor condition. Check my youtube video about that.

Without going into the details of the car itself (hint: I will never go back to an internal combustion engine), this is about the service we've received over the last year from the Tesla Edinburgh Service Centre. Their attitude, helpfulness and attention to detail has been exemplary - after 24 years of high-end German cars, this has been in a different league (in a good way). I have however knocked off a star for a) the pretty poor service provided by Tesla Roadside Assistance and b) for the fact that anything that needs to be referred 'upstairs' at Tesla never seems to receive a resolution.

We been paying this service for a year and still haven been able to used. Service dates even before COVID was from 4-6 month wait period to be schedule, no human interaction on call. After setting up a service you still have to wait another 5 months to get the service. (keep counting months and will be 2 years and no service). Please save yourself the hassle, get a local company this company could care less. Its really a shame.

Awesome companyI have a model 3 and it works AWESOME. I find it cool that they made ventilators for COVID-19 patients. Cool car. Really got to give it to Elon for making a great car

Great car but communication, service and in particular after sales service is appalling. Worst car company I have ever experienced.

don't Evan try and buy it not Evan friendly for the planet The math gets trickier, though, when you include other forms of environmental damage. Electric cars need to be light, which means they include a lot of high-performing metals. The lithium in the batteries, for example, is super light and conductive—that’s how you get a lot of energy without adding a lot of weight. Other, rare metals are sprinkled throughout the car, mostly in the magnets that are in everything from the headlights to the on-board electronics.But those rare metals come from somewhere—often, from environmentally destructive mines. It’s not just Tesla, of course. All electric vehicles rely on parts with similar environmental issues. Even solar panels depend on rare metals that have to be dug out of the earth and processed in less-than-green ways, says David Abraham, author of the book The Elements of Power. They lie to you saying it's environmental friendly when it's not, and when you do get one you just get laughed at

Hoping to buy my very first tesla next month. But from my expereice from driving my friends car, i really love tesla model 3

I bought a Model 3 from their website 6 months ago (existing inventory). I have had no major issues with the car except for a software issue which was resolved over the phone. Once again, I went into their service centre to check my steering wheel alignment and it was done for free, no hassle. I'm a happy customer and have enjoyed every minute of my drive with this car. There are so many aspects of the car that make it different and amazing including autopilot, software updates, easy interaction with the car system...

Car stuck at a supercharger and won’t charge but told they can book it in to be looked at the following week 50 miles away!!!......deeply frustrated and disappointed with Tesla leaving me stranded to sort the issue myself...I’m beginning to ask myself why I even considered buying Tesla.

Amazing company, excellent product, inspiring team!

My car on autosteer steered itself over to the oncoming lane of traffic on a major road (the A47).  It took me over 7 months of being passed from pillar to post to get an answer from Anton Baboglo (Country Service Manager UK & IE) that Tesla had no interest in coming out to see if we could recreate what the car decided to do on 'Autopilot'; no interest whatsoever in offering any compensation for me going over 7 months without a family car and the running/depreciation costs while I waited on their answer; and that they would not even deliver the car to a friend who said he would try to sell the repaired car for me!On top of that the car arrived with deep scratches, which I had to take time out taking the car (twice) to someone at Tesla to get repaired; I was shown a video in a herd of people picking up their Tesla with no warning about the 'autosteer'; and Tesla's defence was there's a couple of lines in the manual, even though they were happy enough for me to drive away without reading the manual!These guys show through their actions that they have no care or pride in building their cars or looking after their customers.It even made zero difference that I bought one of the first Model Xs in the UK for £120,000 (by the way, in the early days of that car with so few customers, the customer service was good) ... unfortunately, there policy of pile them high and ignore customer complaints and hope they go away deserves to drive what is an incredibly innovative company out of business.Elon Musk's hype that this car could drive from West Coast to East Coast of the USA on autopilot ... well there'd be a lot of terrified other road users if he tried with my Model 3 in the state it was in late January 2020!  The worst purchase decision of my life.  Please take the marketing blurb and sales pitches with a pinch of salt and realise that UK customer service won't give a stuff if you have a bad/disappointing experience.p.s. My life partner inherited my Model X ... she's experiencing terrible and random functioning of the air conditioning like others who I've just browsed through here.  She also let me know after that occasionally her 'autosteer' would make a random move like steer into the side of the road suddenly - she's learnt to only trust and use it on the motorway and even then she's super wary and vigilant; I wish I'd been as smart as her and had a couple of taps on the shoulder before my new Model 3 did that out of the blue.  Like all technology, it's great when it works ... sadly you can not rely on the technology in a Tesla.  I deservedly will be banned from driving which is a horrible work and life consequence.Thanks for nothing Tesla!Ian

Over the weekend I ordered an 8.16kW Solar Panel setup for my home and paid the $100.00 deposit. After going through sending pictures and answering a multitude of questions later in the day I received a notification that my design was done and was ready for the next step. I logged and was presented with a big button to click to confirm my order and payment information. After looking closely I saw that the system was a 6.12kW system, not the 8.16kW that I had ordered. Finding this confusing I sent a request for information on what was going on, instead I recevied more e-mails that my order was ready for the next step. I felt like Tesla for some reason was trying to bait and switch me. The required space for the 8.16kW system is 480sqft, I have over 52sqft as measured inside my house, I cancelled the order. Today I was notified by Matt V, that they needed to put a few panels on front of my roof but I didn't want that... I let Matt V know that nobody had ever communicated to me that there was any issues at all and if someone would have contacted me I would have been all for another solution. This was the last communication I had with Tesla Energy.I'm extremely disappointed that the Tesla employees I had to deal with were so complacent in their work that they feel this is ok. That for a $16000+ cash order, they didn't feel it important to reach out to the customer and discuss issues and solutions. Todd

Amazing customer service amazing products. You’re buying into the future. Light Years ahead

Awesome car ... Love my Model 3 ... I was a skeptic at first but no brainer if you have as a company car with 0% BIK on your Tax Allowance.Order using this referral code you will get 1000 free miles at a supercharger too ! -  ts.la / shaun56117 (take out the spaces :) )Be part of the future !

I know you see the 1 star and the title but I want to start off this post by saying I love Tesla cars. I have had a Model S since 2015 and I love hearing about Tesla’s success. When the solar panel price dropped in July 2020 I jumped on the bandwagon happy to support Tesla again. I called family and friends to recommend them adding solar as well. I regret that now and will be telling everyone I can about the worst experience I have had will a company in over a decade…they need to work on their solar side. 1)	The initial process was wonderful and even installation was a positive experience. Those installing the panels were great, courteous and knowledgeable…wait, isn’t that it. Shouldn’t I be happy….2)	The first problem started on day 1 of 2 with the installation. See Tesla doesn’t mention this on their website or even call you beforehand, but pest abatement is extra. This is where they put mesh around your panels to ensure squirrels and birds don’t get in. The cost depends on your size but the original price was $1,500 for the large solar panels…a little much in my opinion and it did feel like a little bait and switch. Also, by going through Tesla it would cover you if any pests did get in. I was told that one chewed wire would cost $700 to fix. If this was the end of the matter I would have still been happy. 3)	I confirmed that I wanted the pest abatement on the second day of the install and they said they would send out a new addendum to the contract. The installers added it. Wonderful, all good. My loan went through for the original price and I was just going to pay Tesla up front for the $1,500 extra when I got the bill. Then…Tesla got paid and everything went silent (they also sent a survey out which I regret giving 5 stars on now). For THREE weeks Tesla did not send any paperwork to my utility company to complete the setup…no solar power, no savings, just paying the loan for something that is not working. Also, it takes the utility company ~4 weeks to turn on the system once they get the paperwork. Tesla has all the paperwork but did not send it. Their excuses: 1)	I did not sign the updated contract with the pest abatement…well, they admitted they forgot to send it. It took them another week to send it…tick tock, no paperwork to the utility company…2)	When they finally did send it the new price was $2,250…yep, they increased the already absurd number. They said they would fix it….another week later and still the wrong price…tick tock, no paperwork sent to the utility company. 3)	Also, during this entire time no one would respond to my calls. You are given one contact (mine was Bever-leigh Holloway) and she would not respond to any of my calls.  I did receive one email after 5 days saying the problem would be fixed in a week or so. There is no one to escalate any issues to good luck. 4)	When I finally got ahold of Bever-leigh, the excuse was they were really backed up, oh, and my calling was only slowing it down more. I am blown away that it is so difficult to send three electronic documents to a utility company. Anyways, my installation was on July 28th, 2020 and it is now September 1st. Tesla is not going to send the paperwork because they are backed up and the pest abatement contract needs to be signed (still has the incorrect price). They will get to fixing the contract in a while. Considering the slow progress, horrible customer service, lack of ability to escalate I do not expect to have the paperwork over to my utility company till mid Sept (if I am lucky) with a potential to have this system on by mid-Oct. My suggestion, go with a local company. They have more skin in the game, better customer service, and the ability to actually get a hold of someone even after you pay them. Oh, and all those recommendations to friends, family and neighbors are gone. My sister-in-law bought them but I am going to try my best to stop anyone else from dealing with this company. It is so sad since I love this company. I will still buy cars from them since I always have the exact opposite experience on that side but I just wish I could have these panels removed and not deal with the solar side.

I bought a Tesla Model S two years ago.My Model S was great to drive and had more performance than I had ever had in a car. It was comfortable for long journeys across Europe and their supercharger network is a 'killer app' that enabled me to travel long distances with not too much planning.They are let down by poor quality - I had to get three significant paint blemishes fixed (free by Tesla) after delivery and the interior materials and quality are not a patch on luxury German cars.Sadly, they couldn't sort out a problem with the media chip on the car: Sometimes, after about a year, I had no media sound for hours, bluetooth wouldn't initialise and I had to learn to perform reboots on the whole system from time to time, sometimes while driving. I also lost confidence after the car's autopilot steered me suddenly into a kerb, damaging a wheel. I mentioned it to Tesla staff, but they didn't seem concerned.I decided to sell the car and asked Tesla for a trade-in price. Their offer was less than 50% of the sales price - so a huge depreciation. I sold it privately in a week for just under 70% of the purchase price. That suggests to me that Tesla are giving no support to the second hand market, but are prioritising massive profit from trade-ins.I loved the car despite its faults and am very likely to buy another one: There have been quite a few updates over the last two years and access to the Tesla supercharger network rules out any other electric cars for me at the moment.I do also have a Powerwall and that is performing way above my expectations after about a year in service. Customer service and information over the phone and email has been way better for me than email and phone service for the car, though the car service centre staff have always been really helpful and polite.

I never thought I'd get a Tesla. I totally love my model. Not sure I can drive any other car after getting my model y.

Simply the best car company. Own it and it's everyday pleasure to drive! Thanks to their's best engineers

model y and CS Bought a model Y - the delivery team that you have in place in TN model exactly what I feel about Tesla - professional, prompt, courteous, clear, smart, insightful, caring and just freaking amazing.   I love our model Y and everything Tesla the company stands for in moving us toward a sustainable energy in our every day life.   Saving earth - loving people.

I called Tesla Roadside assistance back in 2018 on the way to a funeral as I had a puncture, exceptional service they gave me three options to choose how I could complete my journey and make the service.Last weekend I contacted them again as my tyre had a side wall puncture that left me stranded 20miles from home and without any replacements available locally and again found them incredibly helpful, within 15minutes they had found me a tyre that could be figured In a couple of hours. I tried to sort it more cheaply but ended up having to go back to them. They kept in touch while I was waiting and they called after the fitting to check all was ok and they even waived some of the costs. I don’t pay for this service and just want to acknowledge the care from those on the phones who helped me out. Thank you.

I was a bit dubious about writing this review here. All the other reviews relate to Tesla cars and my review is for Tesla Energy. (Trustpilot wouldn’t set up a separate entry as they share a root web address.)I bought a Powerwall 2 and Gateway 2 in December. They have never worked as anticipated but just “sort of” worked. Then in June the Powerwall started being very sluggish in responding to the app. At the beginning of July it seemed to disconnect itself from the system. In a matter of minutes it went from 80% charge to 0%. It was difficult and time consuming to get any response from Tesla support. Then they didn’t believe that I hadn’t switched it off. They took 3 weeks to work out that it was broken. They have given me a replacement date 3 weeks hence, so by the time everything is working again I will have lost nearly 2 months’ use at the time of year when my solar panels are most productive.During my wait I have found that there are several competitors more suited to a smart grid.

I wanted to write this review to counter some of the negative press I’ve read which nearly put me off buying a Tesla, I’m very glad I didn’t allow this to influence my decisionI bought a used Tesla Model S from the Stockport branch in UK. It’s all done online until you collect the car. The buying process could be smoother online and calling works better than email. All the staff I spoke to on the phone were very helpful, pleasant and accurate with the information. Reading some very negative press on some forums I was nervous what the experience was going to be like and what the condition of the car was going to be as you don't see it (only pictures) until the day you collect, although you can refuse to take it on the day.Collection day was great, the staff were pleasant and gave me regular updates on the car being prepared and they left me alone with the car to go over it with no pressure to sign. The car was exactly as described and the staff were very helpful with my questions. They even sent out a full replacement cable next day am delivery when the one in the car I reported with an issue, no questions asked.The car, well it’s brilliant I still have a grin on my face after 2 weeks of collecting it, buying through Tesla I get a 4 year warranty and the remaining 8 year warranty on the battery and drive, something I wasn’t offered via non Tesla dealers the best I could get was 12 months. Also Tesla partner with Direct Line on car insurance and it was by far the cheapest.Would I recommend Tesla and in particular Tesla Stockport, unreservedly yes and ignore the negative press.

From my experience Tesla Inc. is a great company and maintains good product, keep going strong Tesla.

Amazing business leading the way into the future.

Tesla is great but I don’t own a Tesla, now if I did this would definitely be a 5 star review! Amazing what they’re doing

Bought a model S from inventory. They cancelled my pickup appointment on the day (when I was already on the way). Took a week more to get the car from one side of London to the other. On pickup they pointed out some scratches and said I had a week to report in the app - which I did. Now they are saying because I didn’t report them within 100 miles they won’t be repaired!!! What a joke

Model 3 Performance 2020 is the best car we have owned. Ever.  Previously had Audi A6 and A8, but Model 3 is just another league.  Tesla is the only company delivering future-proof cars in 2020:  fully electric, plus full software integration. There is no other company to compete on both aspects.

I bought a tesla 'demo' new car from their NEW inventory and I got it delivered. Then my car was delivered with a rear 2mm dent and I was told by Tesla customer service before delivery about the issues and that it would be repaired and a LOANER would be provided. I then found curb rash and a misallligned door panel. I then put all of these issues in the app and was then contacted by Tesla. They refused to acknowledge the fact that the car came with curb rash and a dent and basically harassed me giving me redirects and when I was assured by Tesla that it would be fixed, the garage called me back saying that Tesla would not accept these issues since it wasn't within 7 days even though it is a 4 YEAR WARRANTY. I am absolutely horrified with Tesla's service. The horror stories of their customer service is true and if you buy a Tesla, NEVER GET IT DELIVERED. Take a checklist and fight with customer service if you have to to make sure your car leaves their perfect with no issues

Service at 6692 Auto Center Drive Buena Park is worst you can imagine. Make you wonder that  what kind of person is running that place. It is such a bad  service Center that I can’t enjoy a nice car because I know every time I go there it is going to be the  same

My experience .. I've had my S 75 RWD since Dec 2017. I've driven over 26k relatively trouble free miles including a recent 2k round trip to the Italian Alps & back last Winter. Tesla's coupe d'etat is their supercharging network, it is second to none & I didn't need do any trip planning beyond a distance map on A Better Route Planner to work out where to book overnight & expect meal stops. The in-car navigation system handled getting us from door-to-door admirably. When permitted, we also drive all over the UK and often go on impromptu day trips which we would never have done in my old car due to cost of petrol. We use the supercharger network whenever we do this, we've never had to use another public charging system, & there is zero inconvenience .. we simply stop for food as we would have to do anyway & plug the car in. The car is usually ready to go before we are! In general day-to-day use we charge at home from solar power where we can or low cost overnight electricity from a renewable supplier where we can't. I can even top-up, for free, when I go shopping as Tesco has multiple free-to-use PodPoint chargers.My car is a joy to drive. I have the performance of a BMW M3 (mine is a "slow" Tesla), Spotify on tap for music, TuneIn for podcasts, a HEPA filter to deal with city pollution, funky country smells & hayfever then AutoPilot to top it all and take the strain on long motorway journeys. All the while cruising along in serene silence emitting zero CO2. I have an app to allow me to heat or cool my car remotely, to let someone into my car & drive it if I need them to even if I'm in another part of the world & I receive regular software updates that add features that my car didn't have when I bought it (a built in dashcam, a video alarm system, "dog mode" to allow animals/people/cream cakes to stay in the car on hot/cold days and maintain the temperature, a multitude of in-car games).I have taken my car to a local HEVRA garage to have it checked over for roadworthy-ness twice, Tesla do not mandate servicing but I feel an annual mechanical check-up is wise. I've not had to change my wiper blades, tyres, brake pads or brake discs (despite having attended 2 separate runway days to safely see just how fast my car will go (140mph) and to test the handling on very wiggly sprint circuits); I've had the HEPA filter cleaned and the pollen filter changed; I have had to top up my screen wash several times .. the costs have been minimal.I've had some warranty claims which have usually been resolved quickly and with minimal fuss, usually by a mobile technician at a place of my choosing, work or home. Issues have been: some cabin rattles/squeaks (you wouldn't have noticed these in a petrol/diesel vehicle due to engine noise), some wind noise (again, would not have been noticeable in a none electric vehicle), a failed bonnet solenoid (manual unlatching was still possible), a steering rack squeak (more grease required) and a seat pad which mysteriously discoloured.I've deducted 1 star as there is always room for improvement & customer communication from Tesla could be better. Because of this they tend to seem a little disorganised when it comes to vehicle collection/service even if, in actual fact, things as far as they're concerned, are all good.So, I would recommend Tesla but with the caveat of they are a tech company making electric vehicles, not a car company trying to do an EV. Tesla will sell you a car in the same way that Apple will sell you a phone .. don't expect them to flatter your ego on the way. If you like buttons & traditional cabins with dealers that fawn over you whilst trying to get an up-sell of some sort, then they won't be for you. If you are a bit of a tech geek willing to accept a bit of rough-round-the-edges while they get it right, well, you won't find a faster "milk float" ;)

Just picked up my  Model S. Amazing car to drive but customer service an absolute shocker.The service from my first sales call to receiving the car and post collection has been diabolical. I have left numerous phone calls and emails all of which have  gone unanswered.Four  issues which need dealing with (1) Crack on small passenger window(they did call me on my way to collect it to let me know) (2) Passenger wheel has been kerbed and scuffed(I had to point that out to them) (3) Some welding on the back interior hatch looks like something i would have botched( I have sent a picture and waiting for a response) (4) Passenger headrest is scuffed. One week on and i am  still waiting for them to communicate with me.All in all a miserable and underwhelming customer experience especially when you consider the cost of them.

Got a leased Tesla a week ago. Good car but pathetic customer service. If one ended up needing them for anything, which you invariably will, that's it. You will be going round and round the circles.Car delivered, no functionality demonstrated. I was not told when delivery was organised by TESLA that it was the case. A very pleasant delivery driver politely said he does not anything about the car!Simple function like opening and closing the car is best done with your mobile app. The mobile app only functions if the car is registered to your account with Tesla. Nearly one week of having the car and having made several calls and two complaints to try and get the car registered to my account, absolutely nothing!!

Bought my new amazing Tesla model S P100D and it is the dream I will never change car brands again found my one true love!

Unbeleivable technology! Love it.

It´s an amazing brand. Fast, comfortable and significantly ahead of other brands. The software part and the possibility to update the car over the air is great.

“The Bulge” its the second time with Tesla Service replacing the entire headrest and it has returned. its very annoying

A Nightmare of a car company at all levels. AVOID AT ALL COST. Model S owner Going Back to Nissan LEAF.Check forums on Battery Gate. Steal paid for functions with software, Apple all over.

Picked one up last summer and I'll never look back. My Model X is the best car I've ever had.

Good service even better car.  Had my tesla for over a year and still happy.

My wife and I took delivery of a new Model 3 late last summer.  Our advice is to do your own detailed Pre-Delivery Inspection to make sure the car is of satisfactory quality.  We didn’t, and within a few days discovered a front sensor not fixed into the bodywork, condensation in the rear light cluster, upholstery blemish and worst of all it rattles like a 1970’s Dagenham Dustbin.  Tesla fixed the sensor and the lights but if you want them to look at anything that rattles they say it is not a warranty issue and you have to pay them to look (and bu***r the Consumer Protection Act presumably).  Technologically a great car, save for the hopelessly overstated range capability shared with other EVs, but our experience is that build quality and service are poor.  By chance, our delivery date came up within a fortnight of us changing our other car, a VW Golf.  Since then we have done 3,500 miles in the Tesla and over 7,000 in the Golf.  Says it all really.

Had a Model  S for three years now.  A good car but thoroughly let down by customer service.  Also the safety systems that take over the steering in some situations often get it totally wrong and thereby make the car feel more dangerous.  And the interior of the car is very cheap with many squeaks and rattles that come and go.   We are really hoping to find a better experience when our contract ends next year and the rest of the car industry has caught up.  We would never go back to internal combustion.

Ignore all the fear, uncertainty and doubt spread by oil companies. Electric is better. Especially Tesla. So far ahead of any other. Minimal cobalt in the batteries. Yes other electric cars are available, but when you add supercharging network and autopilot and the potential for full self driving it’s a no brainier. Also no servicing, unlike Nissan and my old leaf.

I’m yet to take delivery of my model S due to issues at Tesla (hence the 4, not 5 stars) however they have been great in making sure I’m a happy customer. So far so good. They lent me a model 3, and all I can say is it’s amazing. Such a revelation and I really can’t see me ever going back to a ICE car.

I currently have three Teslas and can’t ever imagine driving another car. The drive is unlike any other car I’ve driven - beautiful to drive.

3.5yrs in and I still enjoy every minute driving my Model S. Autopilot is amazing and gets used every day, the cars amazingly comfortable on long journeys, loads of room inside, audio system is great and of course it moves when you put your foot down ;)There’s still nothing the comes close to a Tesla (sadly for the environment)Tesla service has also been excellent, they go above and beyond.You won’t regret buying one

Driving the future, masterpiece

Had some minor cosmetic issues at pickup which were all resolved promptly to my satisfaction. Other than that the car has been flawless.

On to my second Tesla over 4 years now.  Both cars have been totally reliable, good sales experience and after care.  My next car will be a Tesla and I can highly recommend the company.

I’ve had three Teslas, they have all been incredible and all the customer service has been fantastic. The main benefits over every other electric car is the reliable and far reaching super charger network.

I was lured in by the thought of owning a self-driving/fully electric car and placed an order for a Model X. I also ordered a wall charger ahead of receiving the vehicle (wanted to have it installed before arrival). Loan was approved and trade-in/down payment were ready to go. However, earlier that day, my wife and I decided to visit the showroom to get a last look at the vehicle before going through with the purchase. Much to our surprise, the showroom model had noticeable design flaws! Pieces were sticking out, the front hood was too far to one side, amongst other things (this is the showroom model!). To top it off, while we were looking at the car, the service rep was on the phone with a customer and my wife overheard her saying, “We don’t want your friends making fun of you so we’ll take care of it.” We could no longer justify the price for the risk in receiving a poorly made vehicle (with a likelihood of needing repair after repair) and so we canceled the purchase that night. However, since I already placed the order for the wall charger, I needed to return it BUT Tesla refuses to process the return. They flat out ignored 3 requests for the return slip over the span of 2 weeks and I have a limited time to return the item (60 days); their website states they respond within 5 days. I followed their instructions exactly as listed on their website but still never heard back. All I can say at this point is I’m sooo glad we didn’t buy the car and we will certainly never even consider buying a Tesla again (even if they improve quality assurance). I can’t imagine dealing with the nightmare of spending over $100k on a poorly made car and dealing with such bad customer service. Good news is, these wall chargers sell on Amazon for about $1,000 (paid $500 for it) so shouldn’t be hard to recoup my losses. Just a heads up: Don’t buy the wall charger until after you pick up your car (that is if you’re brave enough to go through with the purchase).

After test driving a Tesla Model S, I fell in love! It was fun to drive and had excellent pick-up. For an electric vehicle, I was surprised by how much horsepower this car has. The only feature I didn't like was the cruise control feature. Oddly, the cruise stalk is located right next to the left/right turn signal, so whenever I had to make a right or left turn, I would inadvertently also engage the cruise control. Bad design, but otherwise an excellent (and expensive) vehicle.

I collected my model 3 yesterday. The car I am very happy with but the CUSTOMER SERVICE and buying process is SHOCKINGLY BAD. Buying Process:Worse than supermarket self-checkout without an assistant to hand if there is a problem. Emailed questions don’t get a response. No human contact/acknowledgement on placing your deposit not on paying up the full amount (£55k). On collection I found I was one of 15 or more cars all booked for 3 o'clock collection. A long wait for a brief power point on the car. Nice staff but no time. That’s it - Goodbye!Very production line. Thankfully I had watched independent YouTube posts before that were far more informative than Tesla’s own. Let’s hope the car has no issues🤞

Shocking customer service!!!! Before I saw a car I was interested about I was asked to pay £4000 online, which already makes you feel you don't trust the brand. Then after being told I would get the car two weeks after, I got asked to pay the remaining amount of the car before even being able to see the car. We are talking about another £60k. Yet I told them I would not pay the money until I could see the car. The team at Tesla said they are digital and everything requires payment before delivery and that they would refund me all the money if I wasn't happy with it.I'm glad I refused to pay before seeing the vehicle, because what was two weeks to get my car became a month and I am still fighting for the team to give me clear answers.What was initially a luxury car purchase, has became the worse nightmare and a customer service that not even the cheapest car companies offer. I also called customer service and have a guy screaming at me saying that the process is paying before hand and that if I don't have the vehicle they will refund me. Would you pay interest for my money being at your bank??? seriously a joke of a company. It's putting me off!!!!

Dartford Tesla called me to tell me my vehicle would take 6 weeks “probably less” and despite spending nearly £100,000 all of my e-mails have been ignored, the call centre won’t answer my calls and I now find (at the 6 week point and having sold my last car) that it will not be ready until end of March 2020 “or some point in 2020”. I wouldn’t bother. Other electric cars are available where the concept of customer service is understood

The customer support is shocking from the company. There is no way of contacting service directly, which is a huge issue when something goes wrong with your car, you can get hold of sales or delivery and they will tell you that they will speak to service but they never do. I think I have only ever had 1 call back from service out of possibly 10 requested. Their paintjobs are shocking, which is what I wanted to contact them about, sue to scratches/chips/ severe orange peel at delivery, but the rest of the car is great. Unfortunately because of this, I would not buy another tesla mostly because of the stress it causes when you need to speak to tesla.

The cyber truck is a lie

Got my Red/white Tesla Model 3 LR AWD end of September in Belgium. Love the car, finition, performance, and the savings on petrol, i am now at 4000 km and i have an average of 179 kWh/km. Compare rhis with my Renault ZE Kangoo which had used 10.000 kWh after 40.000 km, so thats 250 kWh/km.Hope that FSD will became legl in EU soon.

These cars are not always being done like you really describe here but for whatever reason it really should be helpfull with such matter anyway. How else ? They have lot of failed models and decisions overall, but I still prefer them over everything else out there.

We are tesla take it or F#@k youwent to order my Tesla model 3 took pictures in the showroom looked on the net. Then went to order and the wheels have changed. Who wants red performance chrome and dark wheels. Really disapointed, just want the correct wheels then i can place my order. Shame cos the showroom guys in Solihill really helpful

I have booked my car in for service. I wont go into the frustration of them trying to get me to pre- authorise  payment for  work that should be carried out under warranty (the car is less than a month old). This is about the COMPLETE LACK of communication. The service experience itself is very slick drive in get a text and promise of updates on progress. They have had my car for 8 hours now to do what I would estimate is an hour or 2 tops. no text no mail no details on the app, Web chat worse than useless, no way of contacting them,  All the people at the service centres are very nice and accommodating however centrally they appear to be trying to design a system that ignores the most important aspect of any business - customers. If you are happy to treated like an inconvenience rather than a customer buy a Tesla. If on the other hand you think spending the kind of money you deserve some communication on what is happening then wait for the Polestar 2. It is a real shame the car is very good if only I didn't  have to deal with Tesla's systems.

I own Tesla Model S over the year now. WOW. What a car. Actually - it is not really a car. I did not had so much excitement since I had my first good car when I was in 20s...Yes - I don't like 5% of the car, but I LOVE 95% of it. This sounds like a good deal for me and I don't get 5% to get on my way :)What is amazing - every month new SW updates are coming in, which basically means that you are getting better car with the time.Service - I was not happy when I could not call Tesla service anymore when back seat car drawer got issue, but quickly realised that all can be done from the mobile app. I found it much more convenient and very effective. Tesla guys arrived to my home at the time which I selected and fixed without a need to bring car to any service or even be there. How great is it?I thought that charging will be a problem, but actually I have developed a mindset of charging (like a mobile phone) and have no problems so far. BTW - when you look, there are quite a lot of places to charge beside Tesla superchargers and many are for free (not the same speed though, but perfectly fine).

Not what it used to be!Went in to Bristol to talk about purchasing the model X p100d (performance), however, the staff were more interested in their laptops and phones.Think I dodged a bullet on this one, as I noticed some very questionable quality and finishing issues on their showroom model X.Shame I can't add the pictures (on Google maps)

Tesla is the world leaders in electric transport, far ahead of all the other motor companies, they genuinely care about making beautiful cars far safer than any other. It is a shame that other motor manufacturers are not making the same efforts to shift us off fossil fuel (petrol/diesel). They are an incredibly innovative company, and I wish them the best in their very noble mission to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy!

Would not recommend buying a Tesla anymore. Have a Model S 100D (2017) bought Feb 2018 and I started out being an ambassador. I even referred another customer who bought a Model S P100D.What changed?First of all. All priced got reduced by 30% in Denmark. This happened within a year after I bought mine. This means that they completely ruined the resale value of my car and also I just wasted a lot of money.Secondly, they removed personal service. It is now IMPOSSIPLE to call Tesla. You are buying a very high priced car where you are expecting some support and a certain service level. Now you have to use their app to schedule a meeting with them and that is with months in delay (before you could call and within a week they would get to you with a proposed solution).Thirdly, we noticed a change in the level of support. In the beginning, the car would always be washed, recharged and we were met with smiles at the Tesla office. Now.... nothing. It's just a struggle now. The employees know nothing about why these things are happening either :( Finally, because of the referral, I did they promised a "Signature Black Tesla Wall Connector" ... It's been a year now. Nothing has happened and I've asked them how long it will take.. the answer? We don't know........ If they would only do something.

TAKE MY MONEY!Trying to buy a Model 3 Performance, called their sales line every day for the last week but it just rings and rings and rings, left it on hold while I was on another call and 30 mins later no answer! Employ people to answer the phone!

Apalling serviceBooked a model 3 in 2018 for a price. Then the price increased, swallowed that, then the delivery dates kept changing swallowed that as well. Now the car is coming next week - height is - delivery team, will give a date and a time slot, which is not negotiable, they can change the date and time till the date of delivery and if one is not present to collect the car, they will just give it to next person in line. Hang on a minute - we are paying almost 60k for a car which none of us have seen forget test driving it and we are being treated like TRASH. You know what TESLA however good your product is it is nothing if you dont have a customer base. I am actually going to cancel my delivery

I ordered a car in March with ‘Expected Delivery’ in June.I called them up at beginning of July and they said mid-July/late July.By mid-July I had heard nothing and called them up again. However, they couldn’t tell me which month it would arrive let alone which date. Meanwhile, their website was still claiming August deliveries on new orders. The final straw was when they increased the price I would have to pay for my car. That’s correct: they wanted more money for the car they had failed to deliver.I cancelled my order and come August I have no car and no refund.In my opinion, the company is just hype and false promises. I hope they sort themselves out and start offering a better service. However, for now, if this is their before-sales service, I hate to see what their after-sales is like.

Open letter to Tesla, CEO Mr. Elon Musk,And to any responsible at Tesla worldwide who might be willing to reply to open questions and or critics and give advice on how to improve and help to have the car repaired in an acceptable way …My Tesla – my cryI bought my Tesla X P100D full option in October 2018.Paid this car 183.000 €uro. (+ 1610€ to install Tesla charger at home)Although I wanted to buy the car only in 2019, Tesla people pushed me to buy it sooner to get free supercharging …  •	A few months later, Tesla reduced the price of my car by 50.000 €.•	Free loading: forget about it:  95% of charging happens at home.  When charging outside, one must wait a very long time – normal loader something like 35 hours, fast loader about + 6 hours.  All this if you find a loader somewhere!•	The money saved on the fuel, you will spend in the snack bar/restaurant waiting for your car to be ready …Sales people in Lisbon (Portugal) are good in their job …; One time we were invited for a small briefing how the car works …  No details – the rest one must find on the internet.After sale = zero;   repair assistance = zero (see further)Range:  so beautiful on paper – reality is so much different.  I live in the Algarve about 250 km away from Lisbon. I cannot reach our capital city without having to lose a few hours to charge. Unless you behave and do not more than 250 Km/hrIn October, after a first wash, we noted that at the rear and on the right wheel there were 2 spots of white paint.  Sent picture to Tesla Portugal and got a reply: “whenever” you come to Lisbon our maintenance will have a look at it …End of October 2018, I sent my first report to Tesla Portugal:Quote:  Objective report on my newly bought Tesla X P100D•	Must be fully loaded to get best/highest (?) acceleration.•	Tesla: The acceleration doesn’t depend that much on the battery level.•	R/ oh yes it does – after 50/75 km one can already feel the difference!•	Rearview mirror inside far too small and does not adapt itself to the driver•	Tesla: To have the best view to the back you can always connect the rear-view camera that gives you a panoramic view of the back. The central rear-view mirror can adapt to yourself manually like any car.•	R/ rear view is on and is perfect – some other luxury cars adapt themselves to the drivers and mirror should have been bigger•	When one closes the car completely (3 clicks) the windows remain open•	Tesla: At this moment we don’t have the automatic closing of the windows. However, we might have it in a future update.•	R/ find this an important shortcoming and a dangerous one.•	No handles above windows•	Tesla: That’s right, we don’t have these handles.•	R/ again a shortcoming for a luxury car•	Compared to my Mercedes S there is little luxury (no TV, no bar, no incorporated tables, no cloth hangers, not everybody  can control temperature in the car, headrests not adjustable, no sunshades for windows,  passengers seat/back cannot  be put down (bed), back massage inside the seats not available, quality of finishing low etc. …)•	Tesla: We are aware that we don’t have these features in our car, however we have some that we believe that are far more important than this, like our Autopilot, over the air updates, etc.•	R/ autopilot which is not allowed in Portugal – and still you sold it to me! … many updates still to be done then …•	When car is closed there is no automatic collapse of the rearview mirrors outside•	Tesla: You can enable this feature on controls>settings>vehicle>Mirror Fold ON•	R/ ok will do (note afterwards: it worked for a while and had to install it again several times)•	GPS still must be handled manually – all modern cars are now by voice instruction/recognition.•	Tesla: You have the voice control where you can tap and say “Navigate To…” and it will show the course on the main screen.•	R/ ok will try it out•	By cleaning the car by high pressure, water infiltrates on two places•	Tesla: Must be checked by Service Center one of these days that you come to Lisbon•	R/ pse give me address, contact and names so we can make a reservation ahead of time (no answer yet …)•	When in drive position and standstill the car rolls back•	Tesla: Creep mode must be OFF, turn Creep mode ON.•	R/ ok where do I find this? (note afterwards: it worked for a while and had to install it again several times)•	Loading times (even by super charger) are not at all correct – a lot less than indicated/promised by Tesla. Impossible for me to drive to Lisbon there and back without stopping twice in Alcacer. When will promises to be executed by putting a lot more super charger (why 10 at Alcacer?)•	Tesla: We are going to install new supercharging locations in 2019•	R/ do you already know where – can indicate a good location in Albufeira … (no answer yet)•	Consoles not at all practical and are too loose•	Tesla: Must be checked by Service Center ‘one of these days’ that you come to Lisbon•	R/ see above•	Back-trunk does not open/close automatically – with modern cars in Europe it does.•	Tesla: You can close automatically by pressing the button on the trunk or the key FOB•	R/ pressing a button is not automatic – what/where is FOB  (in aviation it stands for Free On Board) …  (still no answer)•	Internet / Wi-Fi works badly and often not•	Tesla: We are experiencing some difficulties that are going to be solved with the next software update that you might be receiving soon•	R/ noted•	Rubber alongside doors are loose•	Tesla: Must be checked by Service Center ‘one of these days’ that you come to Lisbon•	R/ see above •	Rear/right wheel with 2 spots of white paint in the middle of the wheel.•	Must be checked by Service Center ‘one of these days’ that you come to Lisbon•	See above •	When windows/glass was glued on the car, rests of Mastic (kind of silicone) were left on the doors (can only been seen when the back doors are open.)•	Must be checked by Service Center ‘one of these days’ that you come to Lisbon•	R/ See above but all these points should not have existed on a new car! Agreed?•	Any idea how long these corrections/repairs may take?•	If need be, is a replacement car available? (no answer at all…)UnquoteUp to this date no further reaction from Tesla!Further shortcomings:No automatic parking No panic stopNo email’s possibleFront window cleaner’s irregular- don’t work or badly in first two positionsDrivers door does not or not always open (fully) automatically Living in Portugal, car bought in Portugal, but computer does not speak Portuguese Car is supposed to connect with remote control to open gate – does not workSeveral times my remote control to the car does not work.When trunk is too full and one tries to close the door anyway, this door is crooked (with light resistance)Detected some other possible constructions faults – will keep pictures for later …Shall I presume my car was build on a Monday or when the computer was out of order …I stop here with the ‘minor’ problems as the big one is yet to come.The car has about 20 sensors … but the Falcon wing doors nor the front doors don’t! No side/downwards sensors! Several times already, when closing the doors, people walking by, were hit!Worse: When door(s) are open, and one starts driving, there is no alarm! The car should not even be allowed to start driving with an open door (e.g. BMW has this) – and when I am in a hurry I do not have time to study the dashboard.Result: left wing door was still open, and I started driving the car outside the carport. (from inside the car, via the outside mirror one cannot see this) – serious crash.So, we contacted Tesla Portugal who gave us a their ‘caroçaria aprovada pela Tesla’ (approved garage) .  We are beginning of February 2019.This seemed to be a Mercedes garage close to Lisbon.  After a while we were notified that the car had to be moved to another Mercedes garage as they could not do this.We talked to the people at Mercedes nr. 2Quote: we will “try” to repair the car …? Yes, will try as this is the first time we do this, and we do not get any assistance from Tesla …  (and indeed see below)Today we are + two months further: No news whatsoever!Waiting – hoping – crying … Unbelievable …  got the car back: 22.04.2019 = almost 3 months after the accident …  Have sent this report to Tesla … No action, no reaction, no reply whatsoever …Just hoping now my car will not start burning …Last comments:When you put a bicycle rack on the back of the car, the distance given on the screen is not correct.The cruise control is very irregular – sometimes the cars stop when it detects another car 15 meter ahead sometimes +50 meter ahead.  It also stops ruffianly iso slowing down when detecting car in front.  It should take the speed of the car in front but does not do it most of the time.Worse and bloody dangerous: when overtaking a truck, being on the same height of the truck the car did a cheeky braking (at 150 km/hr.)Did something go wrong when repairing the falcon door?I cannot close the door anymore from the outside (red bottom)The (repaired ?) door does not open anymore or only partly after a lot of insistance  and indicates there is an obstacle when there is none!The car does not ‘dance’ anymore.Few days ago, we drove to Huelva (Spain) of course no battery enough.  Called Tesla for info – no reply on all numbers known to me - maybe I am already on a blacklist? Computer told me I could load in Alcacer (about 500 km away) but could not reach it with actual reserve… hallo ?After few hours we found a normal (not Tesla) loader in a shopping center.  Although the car was standing still for over 2 hours it refused to be loaded (Manuel book indicates no loading when batteries are warm …)Nice car guys !Wondering if anybody at Tesla worldwide will have the politeness, the courage and or the willingness to react to this mail !?Anybody willing to repair this car !???rest next msg

Own a Model S for nearly 3 years. Amazing car, outstanding service by Tesla Gatwick. I will never go back to a car with an engine. Great network with Tesla Superchargers and lets not forget, it is getting better every day!My next will be Model X at the end of this year.

This review is for Tesla solar panel business.Some of the worst customer service I have ever come across.  I needed to replace my roof because of roof damage and it was a nightmare to deal with Tesla.  Their customer service was anything but.(1) First issue price for removing and then reinstalling solar panelsTesla claims that there prices for solar panel removal and install are based on competitive pricing but I sent over pricing of local installers that provided the same service for significantly less than what Tesla was charging. Tesla rejected my request to review their pricing and did not give a reason why. Additionally, Tesla provided an authorized contractor that could also do the work and that installer also had pricing significantly less than their costs.(2) Per my original paperwork with Solar City it stated that "If you need to make repairs on the roof, the solar panels will need to be removed and re-installed. SolarCity offers this service for a reasonable fee."(3)  Non responsive / Refusing to provide assistance because I contacted the better business bureau.Agents from Tesla would not talk to me because I opened a case with the better business bureau.  They said I had to speak to a specific agent and that agent thought other agents were helping me so did not respond to my calls or emails for days/weeks.(4) Inaccurate informationDifferent representatives would tell me that I could not get the work I needed get Tesla to done on my roof and some said I could.  Representatives who said Tesla could do the would give different information on the pricing or price schedule and it would take literally weeks to get simple questions sorted out.I spent over 8 hours on the phone and many hours on email trying to get this task sorted out and it was just a nightmare.

Slow delivery of my Tesla Powerwall but now that I have had it installed all I can say is - Wow!I have set it to Time based control: cost saving, which magically decides when/whether to import from the grid during my off peak electricity period.This intelligent machine sends solar to the house first, then the surplus to the batttery, then runs the house from the battery after sun down and finally imports from the grid into the battery if necessary to cover my usage before sun rise.Works like a dream.

I liken my first experience driving a Tesla to the time when I first held an iPhone 4. There are few times in my life where I can genuinely say that a new technology is going to be absolutely transformative. Elon's vision has eclipsed that of all the other mainstream automakers. While BMW and Audi are focusing on micro-optimising combustion engines, Tesla have removed all preconceptions about what a car should be and built something incredible. James May recently said that driving a Tesla feels like you're being propelled by magic, I couldn't put it better.

would never buy a car from the company of a guy that calls a child Savior a "pedo guy"  Doubt most of these people's reviews are even legit, one of them says they "purchased a tesla x" yet complain about the price of a Nintendo switch. Yeah right not buying it.

Bought my new amazing Tesla model S P100D and it is the dream I will never change car brands again found my one true love!

Bought the new testa X it's insanely confortable and powerful can you imagine 4.1sec from 0-60mph on an electric car ... my money was well spent thank you elon musk

Amazing performance with lots of confort and I don't even have to pay for gas at all... Thank god elon musk is a genious, I don't ever want to buy a new car since i bought my new model S

Tesla is an incredibly innovative company, with the very noble mission to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. I've been extremely impressed with their communication and customer support while they've ramped up manufacturing of the Model 3 car. They are world leaders in electric transport, far ahead of all the other motor companies. Tesla genuinely cares about making cars which are stunningly designed, safer than any other vehicle and yet does not burn fossil fuels. It is a shame that other motor manufacturers are not making the same efforts to shift us off fossil fuel (petrol/diesel) and onto cleaner and better fuels (electricity/hydrogen).

Best CEO. Best company. Best products.

horrible, horrible customer service! I ordered my car more than 2 weeks ago and found several issues, contacted Tesla and submitted a claim regarding my car and my purchase, they either kept transferring me to the next representative, or just ignore and never reply my email. When I talked to the representative over the phone, it's full of LIES!!!!! I'm very disappointed with Tesla

The worst customer service I've experienced to date with any company to date. Avoid at all costs and take your Tesla anywhere but here. Gave a car out from their service centre claiming it had sufficient charge to get to our destination to then break down on the M25 in the snow. Having called them we were told that they would not offer any roadside assistance or support. We were then to recover the vehicle ourselves. Now to be told that only Tesla can open the Charge point but refuse to come and open it for us. Left with a £65,000 statue and no solution. Appauling
